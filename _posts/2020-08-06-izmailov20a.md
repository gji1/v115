title: Subspace Inference for Bayesian Deep Learning
abstract: Bayesian inference was once a gold standard for learning with neural networks,
  providing accurate full predictive distributions and well calibrated uncertainty.
  However, scaling Bayesian inference techniques to deep neural networks is challenging
  due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space. In this paper, we construct
  low-dimensional subspaces of parameter space, such as the first principal components
  of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectory, which contain diverse sets
  of high performing models. In these subspaces, we are able to apply elliptical slice
  sampling and variational inference, which struggle in the full parameter space.
  We show that Bayesian model averaging over the induced posterior in these subspaces
  produces accurate predictions and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty for both
  regression and image classification.
