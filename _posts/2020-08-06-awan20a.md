title: Interpretable Almost Matching Exactly With Instrumental Variables
abstract: Uncertainty in the estimation of the causal effect in observational studies
  is often due to unmeasured confounding, i.e., the presence of unobserved covariates
  linking treatments and outcomes. Instrumental Variables (IV) are commonly used to
  reduce the effects of unmeasured confounding. Existing methods for IV estimation
  either require strong parametric assumptions, use arbitrary distance metrics, or
  do not scale well to large datasets. We propose a matching framework for IV in the
  presence of observed categorical confounders that addresses these weaknesses. Our
  method first matches units exactly, and then consecutively drops variables to approximately
  match the remaining units on as many variables as possible. We show that our algorithm
  constructs better matches than other existing methods on simulated datasets, and
  we produce interesting results in an application to political canvassing.
