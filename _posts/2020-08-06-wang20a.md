title: Conditional Expectation Propagation
abstract: Expectation propagation (EP) is a powerful approximate inference algorithm.
  However, a critical barrier in applying EP is that the moment matching in message
  updates can be intractable. Handcrafting approximations is usually tricky, and lacks
  generalizability. Importance sampling is very expensive. While Laplace propagation
  offers an excellent solution, it has to run numerical optimizations to find Laplace
  approximations in every update, which is still quite inefficient. To overcome these
  practical barriers, we propose conditional expectation propagation (CEP) that performs
  conditional moment matching given the variables outside each message fixed, and
  then takes expectation w.r.t their approximate posterior. The conditional moments
  are often analytical and much easier to derive. In the most general case, we can
  use (fully) factorized messages so that the conditional moments can be represented
  by quadrature formulas. We then compute the expectation of the conditional moments
  via Taylor approximations when necessary. In this way, our algorithm can always
  conduct efficient, analytical fixed point iterations. Experiments on several popular
  models for which standard EP is available or unavailable demonstrate the advantages
  of CEP in both inference quality and computational efficiency.
