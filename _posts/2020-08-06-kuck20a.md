title: Adaptive Hashing for Model Counting
abstract: Randomized hashing algorithms have seen recent success in providing bounds
  on the model count of a propositional formula.  These methods repeatedly check the
  satisfiability of a formula subject to increasingly stringent random constraints.  Key
  to these approaches is the choice of a fixed family of hash functions that strikes
  a good balance between computational efficiency and statistical guarantees for a
  hypothetical worst case formula.  In this paper we propose a scheme where the family
  of hash functions is chosen adaptively, based on properties of the specific input
  formula.  Akin to adaptive importance sampling, we use solutions to the formula
  (found during the bounding procedure of current methods) to estimate properties
  of the solution set, which guides the construction of random constraints. Additionally,
  we introduce an orthogonal variance reduction technique that is broadly applicable
  to hashing based methods.  We empirically show that, when combined, these approaches
  lead to better lower bounds on existing benchmarks, with a median improvement factor
  of 2^13 over 1,198 propositional formulas.
