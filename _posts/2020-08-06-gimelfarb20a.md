title: 'Epsilon-BMC: A Bayesian Ensemble Approach to Epsilon-Greedy Exploration in
  Model-Free Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: Resolving the exploration-exploitation trade-off remains a fundamental problem
  in the design and implementation of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In this
  paper, we focus on model-free RL using the epsilon-greedy exploration policy, which
  despite its simplicity, remains one of the most frequently used forms of exploration.
  However, a key limitation of this policy is the specification of epsilon. In this
  paper, we provide a novel Bayesian perspective of epsilon as a measure of the uncertainty
  (and hence convergence) in the Q-value function. We introduce a closed-form Bayesian
  model update based on Bayesian model combination (BMC), based on this new perspective,
  which allows us to adapt epsilon using experiences from the environment in constant
  time with monotone convergence guarantees. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm,
  epsilon-BMC, efficiently balances exploration and exploitation on different problems,
  performing comparably or outperforming the best tuned fixed annealing schedules
  and an alternative data-dependent epsilon adaptation scheme proposed in the literature.
