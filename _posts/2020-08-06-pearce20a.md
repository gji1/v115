title: 'Expressive Priors in Bayesian Neural Networks: Kernel Combinations and Periodic
  Functions'
abstract: A simple, flexible approach to creating expressive priors in Gaussian process
  (GP) models makes new kernels from a combination of basic kernels, e.g. summing
  a periodic and linear kernel can capture seasonal variation with a long term trend.
  Despite a well-studied link between GPs and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), the
  BNN analogue of this has not yet been explored. This paper derives BNN architectures
  mirroring such kernel combinations. Furthermore, it shows how BNNs can produce periodic
  kernels, which are often useful in this context. These ideas provide a principled
  approach to designing BNNs that incorporate prior knowledge about a function. We
  showcase the practical value of these ideas with illustrative experiments in supervised
  and reinforcement learning settings.
