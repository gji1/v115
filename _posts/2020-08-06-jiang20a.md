title: Wasserstein Fair Classification
abstract: We propose an approach to fair classification that enforces independence
  between the classifier outputs and sensitive information by minimizing Wasserstein-1
  distances. The approach has desirable theoretical properties and is robust to specific
  choices of the threshold used to obtain class predictions from model outputs.We
  introduce different methods that enable hid-ing sensitive information at test time
  or have a simple and fast implementation.  We show empirical  performance  against  different  fair-ness
  baselines on several benchmark fairness datasets.
