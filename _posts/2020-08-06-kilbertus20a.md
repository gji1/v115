title: The Sensitivity of Counterfactual Fairness to Unmeasured Confounding
abstract: 'Causal approaches to fairness have seen substantial recent interest, both
  from the machine learning community and from wider parties interested in ethical
  prediction algorithms. In no small part, this has been due to the fact that causal
  models allow one to simultaneously leverage data and expert knowledge to remove
  discriminatory effects from predictions. However, one of the primary assumptions
  in causal modeling is that you know the causal graph. This introduces a new opportunity
  for bias, caused by misspecifying the causal model. One common way for misspecification
  to occur is via unmeasured confounding: the true causal effect between variables
  is partially described by unobserved quantities. In this work we design tools to
  assess the sensitivity of fairness measures to this confounding for the popular
  class of non-linear additive noise models (ANMs). Specifically, we give a procedure
  for computing the maximum difference between two counterfactually fair predictors,
  where one has become biased due to confounding. For the case of bivariate confounding
  our technique can be swiftly computed via a sequence of closed-form updates. For
  multivariate confounding we give an algorithm that can be efficiently solved via
  automatic differentiation. We demonstrate our new sensitivity analysis tools in
  real-world fairness scenarios to assess the bias arising from confounding.'
