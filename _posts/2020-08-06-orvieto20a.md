title: The Role of Memory in Stochastic Optimization
abstract: The choice of how to retain information about past gradients dramatically
  affects the convergence properties of state-of-the-art stochastic optimization methods,
  such as Heavy-ball, Nesterov’s momentum, RMSprop and Adam. Building on this observation,
  we use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to explicitly study the role of
  memory in gradient-based algorithms. We first derive a general continuous-time model
  that can incorporate arbitrary types of memory, for both deterministic and stochastic
  settings. We provide convergence guarantees for this SDE for weakly-quasi-convex
  and quadratically growing functions. We then demonstrate how to discretize this
  SDE to get a flexible discrete-time algorithm that can implement a board spectrum
  of memories ranging from short- to long-term. Not only does this algorithm increase
  the degrees of freedom in algorithmic choice for practitioners but it also comes
  with better stability properties than classical momentum in the convex stochastic
  setting. In particular, no iterate averaging is needed for convergence. Interestingly,
  our analysis also provides a novel interpretation of Nesterov’s momentum as stable
  gradient amplification and highlights a possible reason for its unstable behavior
  in the (convex) stochastic setting. Furthermore, we discuss the use of long term
  memory for second-moment estimation in adaptive methods, such as Adam and RMSprop.
  Finally, we provide an extensive experimental study of the effect of different types
  of memory in both convex and nonconvex settings.
