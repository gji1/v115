title: Block Neural Autoregressive Flow
abstract: Normalising flows (NFs) map two density functions via a differentiable bijection
  whose Jacobian determinant can be computed efficiently. Recently, as an alternative
  to hand-crafted bijections, Huang et al. (2018) proposed neural autoregressive flow
  (NAF) which is a universal approximator for density functions. Their flow is a neural
  network (NN) whose parameters are predicted by another NN. The latter grows quadratically
  with the size of the former and thus an efficient technique for parametrization
  is needed. We propose block neural autoregressive flow (B-NAF), a much more compact
  universal approximator of density functions, where we model a bijection directly
  using a single feed-forward network. Invertibility is ensured by carefully designing
  each affine transformation with block matrices that make the flow autoregressive
  and (strictly) monotone. We compare B-NAF to NAF and other established flows on
  density estimation and approximate inference for latent variable models. Our proposed
  flow is competitive across datasets while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.
