title: Identification In Missing Data Models Represented By Directed Acyclic Graphs
abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in data analyses, resulting in datasets
  that contain censored realizations of a target distribution. Many approaches to
  inference on the target distribution using censored observed data, rely on missing
  data models represented as a factorization with respect to a directed acyclic graph.
  In this paper we consider the identifiability of the target distribution within
  this class of models, and show that the most general identification strategies proposed
  so far retain a significant gap in that they fail to identify a wide class of identifiable
  distributions. To address this gap, we propose a new algorithm that significantly
  generalizes the types of manipulations used in the ID algorithm [14, 16], developed
  in the context of causal inference, in order to obtain identification.
