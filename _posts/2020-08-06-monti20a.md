title: Causal Discovery with General Non-Linear Relationships using Non-Linear ICA
abstract: 'We consider the problem of inferring causal relationships between two or
  more passively observed variables. While the problem of such causal discovery has
  been extensively studied especially in the bivariate setting, the majority of current
  methods assume a linear causal relationship, and the few methods which consider
  non-linear dependencies usually make the assumption of additive noise. Here, we
  propose a framework through which we can perform causal discovery in the presence
  of general non-linear relationships. The proposed method is based on recent progress
  in non-linear independent component analysis and exploits the non-stationarity of
  observations in order to recover the underlying sources or latent disturbances.
  We show rigorously that in the case of bivariate causal discovery, such non-linear
  ICA can be used to infer the causal direction via a series of independence tests.
  We further propose an alternative measure of causal direction based on asymptotic
  approximations to the likelihood ratio, as well as an extension to multivariate
  causal discovery. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method via a series
  of simulation studies and conclude with an application to neuroimaging data. '
