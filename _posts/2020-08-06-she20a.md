title: Neural Dynamics Discovery via Gaussian Process Recurrent Neural Networks
abstract: Latent dynamics discovery is challenging in extracting complex dynamics
  from highdimensional noisy neural data. Many dimensionality reduction methods have
  been widely adopted to extract low-dimensional, smooth and time-evolving latent
  trajectories. However, simple state transition structures, linear embedding assumptions,
  or inflexible inference networks impede the accurate recovery of dynamic portraits.
  In this paper, we propose a novel latent dynamic model that is capable of capturing
  nonlinear, non- Markovian, long short-term time-dependent dynamics via recurrent
  neural networks and tackling complex nonlinear embedding via non-parametric Gaussian
  process. Due to the complexity and intractability of the model and its inference,
  we also provide a powerful inference network with bi-directional long short-term
  memory networks that encode both past and future information into posterior distributions.
  In the experiment, we show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
  in reconstructing insightful latent dynamics from both simulated and experimental
  neural datasets with either Gaussian or Poisson observations, especially in the  low-sample
  scenario. Our codes and additional materials are available at https://github.com/sheqi/GP-RNN_UAI2019.
