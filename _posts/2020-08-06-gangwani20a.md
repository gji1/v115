title: Learning Belief Representations for Imitation Learning in POMDPs
abstract: We consider the problem of imitation learning from expert demonstrations
  in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Belief representations,
  which characterize the distribution over the latent states in a POMDP, have been
  modeled using recurrent neural networks and probabilistic latent variable models,
  and shown to be effective for reinforcement learning in POMDPs. In this work, we
  investigate the belief representation learning problem for generative adversarial
  imitation learning in POMDPs. Instead of training the belief module and the policy
  separately as suggested in prior work, we learn the belief module jointly with the
  policy, using a task-aware imitation loss to ensure that the representation is more
  aligned with the policyâ€™s objective. To improve robustness of representation, we
  introduce several informative belief regularization techniques, including multi-step
  prediction of dynamics and action-sequences. Evaluated on various partially observable
  continuous-control locomotion tasks, our belief-module imitation learning approach
  (BMIL) substantially outperforms several baselines, including the original GAIL
  algorithm and the task-agnostic belief learning algorithm. Extensive ablation analysis
  indicates the effectiveness of task-aware belief learning and belief regularization.
  Code for the project is available online.
