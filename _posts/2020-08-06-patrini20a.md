title: Sinkhorn AutoEncoders
abstract: 'Optimal transport offers an alternative to maximum likelihood for learning
  generative autoencoding models. We show that minimizing the $p$-Wasserstein distance
  between the generator and the true data distribution is equivalent to the unconstrained
  min-min optimization of the $p$-Wasserstein distance between the encoder aggregated
  posterior and the prior in latent space, plus a reconstruction error. We also identify
  the role of its trade-off hyperparameter as the capacity of the generator: its Lipschitz
  constant. Moreover, we prove that optimizing the encoder over any class of universal
  approximators, such as deterministic neural networks, is enough to come arbitrarily
  close to the optimum. We therefore advertise this framework, which holds for any
  metric space and prior, as a sweet-spot of current generative autoencoding objectives.We
  then introduce the Sinkhorn autoencoder (SAE), which approximates and minimizes
  the $p$-Wasserstein distance in latent space via backprogation through the Sinkhorn
  algorithm. SAE directly works on samples, i.e. it models the aggregated posterior
  as an implicit distribution, with no need for a reparameterization trick for gradients
  estimations. SAE is thus able to work with different metric spaces and priors with
  minimal adaptations. We demonstrate the flexibility of SAE on latent spaces with
  different geometries and priors and compare with other methods on benchmark data
  sets.'
