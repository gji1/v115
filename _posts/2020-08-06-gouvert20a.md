title: Recommendation from Raw Data with Adaptive Compound Poisson Factorization
abstract: 'Count data are often used in recommender systems: they are widespread (song
  play counts, product purchases, clicks on web pages) and can reveal user preference
  without any explicit rating from the user. Such data are known to be sparse, over-dispersed
  and bursty, which makes their direct use in recommender systems challenging, often
  leading to pre-processing steps such as binarization. The aim of this paper is to
  build recommender systems from these raw data, by means of the recently proposed
  compound Poisson Factorization (cPF). The paper contributions are three-fold: we
  present a unified framework for discrete data (dcPF), leading to an adaptive and
  scalable algorithm; we show that our framework achieves a trade-off between Poisson
  Factorization (PF) applied to raw and binarized data; we study four specific instances
  that are relevant to recommendation and exhibit new links with combinatorics. Experiments
  with three different datasets show that dcPF is able to effectively adjust to over-dispersion,
  leading to better recommendation scores when compared with PF on either raw or binarized
  data.'
