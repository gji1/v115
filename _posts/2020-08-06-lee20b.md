title: General Identifiability with Arbitrary Surrogate Experiments
abstract: We study the problem of causal identification from an arbitrary collection
  of observational and experimental distributions, and substantive knowledge about
  the phenomenon under investigation, which usually comes in the form of a causal
  graph. We call this problem  \textit{g-identifiability}, or gID for short. The gID
  setting encompasses two  well-known problems in causal inference, namely, identifiability
  [Pearl, 1995] and z-identifiability [Bareinboim and Pearl, 2012] â€“ the former assumes
  that an observational distribution is necessarily available, and no experiments
  can be performed, conditions that are both relaxed in the gID setting; the latter
  assumes that \textit{all} combinations of experiments are available, i.e., the power
  set of the experimental set $\mathbf{Z}$, which gID does not require a priori. In
  this paper, we introduce a general strategy to prove non-gID based on \textit{hedgelets}
  and \textit{thickets}, which leads to a necessary and sufficient graphical condition
  for the corresponding decision problem. We further develop a procedure for systematically
  computing the target effect, and prove that it is sound and complete for gID instances.
  In other words, failure of the algorithm in returning an expression implies that
  the target effect is not computable from the available distributions. Finally, as
  a corollary of these results, we show that do-calculus is complete for the task
  of g-identifiability.
