title: Exclusivity Graph Approach to Instrumental Inequalities
abstract: 'Instrumental variables allow the estimation of cause and effect relations
  even in presence of unobserved latent factors, thus providing a powerful tool for
  any science wherein causal inference plays an important role. More recently, the
  instrumental scenario has also attracted increasing attention in quantum physics,
  since it is related to the seminal Bellâ€™s theorem and in fact allows the detection
  of even stronger quantum effects, thus enhancing our current capabilities to process
  information and becoming a valuable tool in quantum cryptography. In this work,
  we further explore this bridge between causality and quantum theory and apply a
  technique, originally developed in the field of quantum foundations, to express
  the constraints implied by causal relations in the language of graph theory. This
  new approach can be applied to any causal model containing a latent variable. Here,
  by focusing on the instrumental scenario, it allows us to easily reproduce known
  results as well as obtain new ones and gain new insights on the connections and
  differences between the instrumental and the Bell scenarios. '
