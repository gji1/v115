title: Evacuate or Not? A POMDP Model of the Decision Making of Individuals in Hurricane
  Evacuation Zones
abstract: Recent hurricanes in the Atlantic region of the southern United States triggered
  a series of evacuation orders in the coastal cities of Florida, Georgia, and Texas.
  While some of these urged voluntary evacuations, most were mandatory orders. Despite
  governments asking people to vacate their homes for their own safety, many do not.
  We aim to understand the observable and hidden variables involved in the decision-making
  process and model these in a partially observable Markov decision process, which
  predicts whether a person will evacuate or not given his or her current situation.
  We consider the features of the particular hurricane, the dynamic situation that
  the individual is experiencing, and demographic factors that influence the decision
  making of individuals. The process model is represented as a dynamic influence diagram
  and evaluated on data collected via a comprehensive survey of hurricane-impacted
  individuals.
