title: A Bayesian Approach to Robust Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) intend to ensure robustness with
  respect to changing or adversarial system behavior. In this framework, transitions
  are modeled as arbitrary elements of a known and properly structured uncertainty
  set and a robust optimal policy can be derived under the worst-case scenario. In
  this study, we address the issue of learning in RMDPs using a Bayesian approach.
  We introduce the Uncertainty Robust Bellman Equation (URBE) which encourages safe
  exploration for adapting the uncertainty set to new observations while preserving
  robustness. We propose a URBE-based algorithm, DQN-URBE, that scales this method
  to higher dimensional domains. Our experiments show that the derived URBE-based
  strategy leads to a better trade-off between less conservative solutions and robustness
  in the presence of model misspecification. In addition, we show that the DQN-URBE
  algorithm can adapt significantly faster to changing dynamics online compared to
  existing robust techniques with fixed uncertainty sets.
