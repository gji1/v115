title: A Flexible Framework for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization using Random
  Scalarizations
abstract: Many real world applications can be framed as multi-objective optimization
  problems, where we wish to simultaneously optimize for multiple criteria. Bayesian
  optimization techniques for the multi-objective setting are pertinent when the evaluation
  of the functions in question are expensive. Traditional methods for multi-objective
  optimization, both Bayesian and otherwise, are aimed at recovering the Pareto front
  of these objectives. However, in certain cases a practitioner might desire to identify
  Pareto optimal points only in a subset of the Pareto front due to external considerations.
  In this work, we propose a strategy based on random scalarizations of the objectives
  that addresses this problem. Our approach is able to flexibly sample from desired
  regions of the Pareto front and, computationally, is considerably cheaper than most
  approaches for MOO. We also study a notion of regret in the multi-objective setting
  and show that our strategy achieves sublinear regret. We experiment with both synthetic
  and real-life problems, and demonstrate superior performance of our proposed algorithm
  in terms of the flexibility and regret.
