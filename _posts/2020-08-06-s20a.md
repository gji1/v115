title: 'Be Greedy: How Chromatic Number meets Regret Minimization in Graph Bandits'
abstract: We study the classical linear bandit problem on \emph{graphs} modelling
  arm rewards through an underlying graph structure $G$($N$,$E$) such that rewards
  of neighboring nodes are similar. Previous attempts along this line have primarily
  considered the arm rewards to be a smooth function over graph Laplacian, which however
  failed to characterize the inherent problem complexity in terms of the graph structure.
  We bridge this gap by showing a regret guarantee of $\tO(\chi(\overline{G})\sqrt{T})$
  ($\tO(\cdot)$ notation hides dependencies on $\log T$), that scales only with the
  chromatic number of the complement graph $\chi(\overline{G})$, assuming the rewards
  to be a smooth function over a general class of graph embeddings—\emph{Orthonormal
  Representations}. Our proposed algorithms yield a regret guarantee of $\tilde O(r\sqrt
  T)$ for any general embedding of rank $r$. Furthermore, if the rewards correspond
  to a minimum rank embedding, the regret boils down to $O(\chi(\overline{G})\sqrt{T})$—none
  of the existing works were able to bring out such influences of graph structures
  over arm rewards. Finally noting that computing the above minimum rank embedding
  is NP-Hard, we also propose an alternative $O(N + |E|)$ time computable embedding
  scheme—{\it Greedy Embeddings}—based on greedy graph coloring, on which our algorithms
  perform optimally on a large family of graphs, e.g. union of cliques, complement
  of $k$-colorable graphs, regular graphs etc, and are also shown to  outperform the
  state-of-the-art methods on real datasets. Our findings open up new roads for exploiting
  graph structures on regret performance.
