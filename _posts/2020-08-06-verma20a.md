title: Correlated Learning for Aggregation Systems
abstract: Aggregation systems (e.g., Uber, Lyft, Food- Panda, Deliveroo) have been
  increasingly used to improve efficiency in numerous environments, including in transportation,
  logistics, food and grocery delivery. In these systems, a centralized entity (e.g.,
  Uber) aggregates sup- ply and assigns them to demand so as to optimize a central
  metric such as profit, number of requests, delay etc. Due to optimizing a metric
  of importance to the centralized entity, the interests of individuals (e.g., drivers,
  de- livery boys) can be sacrificed. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the problem
  of serving individual interests, i.e., learning revenue maximizing policies for
  individuals in the presence of a self interested central entity. Since there are
  large number of learning agents that are homogenous, we represent the problem as
  an Anonymous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learn- ing (AyMARL) problem. By using the
  self interested centralized entity as a correlation entity, we provide a novel learning
  mechanism that helps individual agents to maximize their individual revenue. Our
  Correlated Learning (CL) algorithm is able to outperform existing mechanisms on
  a generic simulator for aggregation systems and multiple other benchmark Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems.
