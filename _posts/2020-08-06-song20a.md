title: 'Sliced Score Matching: A Scalable Approach to Density and Score Estimation'
abstract: Score matching is a popular method for estimating unnormalized statistical
  models. However, it has been so far limited to simple, shallow models or low-dimensional
  data, due to the difficulty of computing the Hessian of log-density functions. We
  show this difficulty can be mitigated by projecting the scores onto random vectors
  before comparing them. This objective, called sliced score matching, only involves
  Hessian-vector products, which can be easily implemented using reverse-mode automatic
  differentiation. Therefore, sliced score matching is amenable to more complex models
  and higher dimensional data compared to score matching. Theoretically, we prove
  the consistency and asymptotic normality of sliced score matching estimators. Moreover,
  we demonstrate that sliced score matching can be used to learn deep score estimators
  for implicit distributions. In our experiments, we show sliced score matching can
  learn deep energy-based models effectively, and can produce accurate score estimates
  for applications such as variational inference with implicit distributions and training
  Wasserstein Auto-Encoders.
