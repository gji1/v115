title: Stability of Linear Structural Equation Models of Causal Inference
abstract: 'We consider numerical stability of the parameter recovery problem in Linear
  Structural Equation Model (LSEM) of causal inference. Numerical stability is essential
  for the recovered parameters to be reliable. A long line of work starting from Wright
  (1920) has focused on understanding which sub-classes of LSEM allow for efficient
  parameter recovery. Despite decades of study, this question is not yet fully resolved.
  The goal of the present paper is complementary to this line of work: we want to
  understand the stability of the recovery problem in the cases when efficient recovery
  is possible. Numerical stability of Pearlâ€™s notion of causality was first studied
  in Schulman and Srivastava (2016) using the concept of condition number where they
  provide ill-conditioned examples. In this work, we provide a condition number analysis
  for the LSEM. First we prove that under a sufficient condition, for a certain sub-class
  of LSEM that are bow-free (Brito and Pearl (2002)), parameter recovery is numerically
  stable. We further prove that randomly chosen input parameters for this family satisfy
  the condition with a substantial probability. Hence for this family, on a large
  subset of parameter space, recovery is stable. Next we construct an example of LSEM
  on four vertices with unbounded condition number. We then corroborate our theoretical
  findings via simulations as well as real-world experiments for a sociology application.
  Finally, we provide a general heuristic for estimating the condition number of any
  LSEM instance. '
