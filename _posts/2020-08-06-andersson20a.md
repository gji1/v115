title: Real-Time Robotic Search using Structural Spatial Point Processes
abstract: Aerial robots hold great potential for aiding Search and Rescue (SAR) efforts
  over large areas, such as during natural disasters. Traditional approaches typically
  search an area exhaustively, thereby ignoring that the density of victims varies
  based on predictable factors, such as the terrain, population density and the type
  of disaster. We present a probabilistic model to automate SAR planning, with explicit
  minimization of the expected time to discovery. The proposed model is a spatial
  point process with three interacting spatial fields for i) the point patterns of
  persons in the area, ii) the probability of detecting persons and iii) the probability
  of injury. This structure allows inclusion of informative priors from e.g. geographic
  or cell phone traffic data, while falling back to latent Gaussian processes when
  priors are missing or inaccurate. To solve this problem in real-time, we propose
  a combination of fast approximate inference using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation
  (INLA), and a novel Monte Carlo tree search tailored to the problem. Experiments
  using data simulated from real world Geographic Information System (GIS) maps show
  that the framework outperforms competing approaches, finding many more injured in
  the crucial first hours.
