title: 'Fall of Empires: Breaking Byzantine-tolerant SGD by Inner Product Manipulation'
abstract: 'Recently, new defense techniques have been developed to tolerate Byzantine
  failures for distributed machine learning. The Byzantine model captures  workers
  that behave arbitrarily, including malicious and compromised workers. In this paper,
  we  break two prevailing Byzantine-tolerant techniques. Specifically we show that
  two robust aggregation methods for synchronous SGD–namely, coordinate-wise median
  and Krum–can be broken using new attack strategies based on inner product manipulation.
  We prove our results theoretically, as well as show empirical validation.  '
