title: Causal Calculus in the Presence of Cycles, Latent Confounders and Selection
  Bias
abstract: We prove the main rules of causal calculus (also called do-calculus) for
  i/o structural causal models (ioSCMs), a generalization of a recently proposed general
  class of non-linear structural causal models that allow for cycles, latent confounders
  and arbitrary probability distributions. We also generalize adjustment criteria
  and formulas from the acyclic setting to the general one (i.e. ioSCMs). Such criteria
  then allow to estimate (conditional) causal effects from observational data that
  was (partially) gathered under selection bias and cycles. This generalizes the backdoor
  criterion, the selection-backdoor criterion and extensions of these to arbitrary
  ioSCMs. Together, our results thus enable causal reasoning in the presence of cycles,
  latent confounders and selection bias. Finally, we extend the ID algorithm for the
  identification of causal effects to ioSCMs.
