title: 'Fake It Till You Make It: Learning-Compatible Performance Support'
abstract: A longstanding goal of artificial intelligence is to develop technologies
  that augment or assist humans. Current approaches to developing agents that can
  assist humans focus on adapting behavior of the assistant, and do not consider the
  potential for assistants to support human learning. We argue that in many cases
  it is worthwhile to provide assistance in a manner that also promotes task learning
  or skill maintenance. We term such assistance Learning-Compatible Performance Support,
  and present the Stochastic Q Bumpers algorithm for greatly improving learning outcomes
  while still providing high levels of performance support. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach in multiple domains, including a complex flight control task.
