title: Efficient Multitask Feature and Relationship Learning
abstract: We consider a multitask learning problem, in which several predictors are
  learned jointly. Prior research has shown that learning the relations between tasks,
  and between the input features, together with the predictor, can lead to better
  generalization and interpretability, which proved to be useful for applications
  in many domains. In this paper, we consider a formulation of multitask learning
  that learns the relationships both between tasks and between features, represented
  through a task covariance and a feature covariance matrix, respectively. First,
  we demonstrate that existing methods proposed for this problem present an issue
  that may lead to ill-posed optimization. We then propose an alternative formulation,
  as well as an efficient algorithm to optimize it. Using ideas from optimization
  and graph theory, we propose an efficient coordinate-wise minimization algorithm
  that has a closed form solution for each block subproblem. Our experiments show
  that the proposed optimization method is orders of magnitude faster than its competitors.
  We also provide a nonlinear extension that is able to achieve better generalization
  than existing methods.
