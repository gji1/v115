title: Periodic Kernel Approximation by Index Set Fourier Series Features
abstract: 'Periodicity is often studied in timeseries modelling with autoregressive
  methods but is less popular in the kernel literature, particularly for multi-dimensional
  problems such as in textures, crystallography, quantum mechanics, and robotics.
  Large datasets often make modelling periodicity untenable for otherwise powerful
  non-parametric methods like Gaussian Processes (GPs) which typically incur an $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$
  computational cost, while approximate feature methods are impeded by their approximate
  accuracy. We introduce a method that efficiently decomposes multi-dimensional periodic
  kernels into a set of basis functions by exploiting multivariate Fourier series.
  Termed \emph{Index Set Fourier Series Features}, we show that our approximation
  produces significantly less predictive generalisation error than alternative approximations
  such as those based on random and deterministic Fourier features on regression problems
  with periodic data. '
