title: Approximate Causal Abstractions
abstract: Scientific models describe natural phenomena at different levels of abstraction.
  Abstract descriptions can provide the basis for interventions on the system and
  explanation of observed phenomena at a level of granularity that is coarser than
  the most fundamental account of the system. Beckers and Halpern (2019), building
  on prior work of Rubinstein et al. (2017), developed an account of abstraction for
  causal models that is exact. Here we extend this account to the more realistic case
  where an abstract causal model only offers an approximation of the underlying system.
  We show how the resulting account handles the discrepancy that can arise between
  low- and high-level causal models of the same system, and in the process provide
  an account of how one causal model approximates another, a topic of independent
  interest. Finally, we extend the account of approximate abstractions to probabilistic
  causal models, indicating how and where uncertainty can enter into an approximate
  abstraction.
