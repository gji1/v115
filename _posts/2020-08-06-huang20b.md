title: Guaranteed Scalable Learning of Latent Tree Models
abstract: 'We present an integrated approach to structure and parameter estimation
  in latent tree graphical models, where some nodes are hidden. Our overall approach
  follows a “divide-and-conquer” strategy that learns models  over small groups of
  variables and iteratively merges into a global solution.   The structure learning
  involves  combinatorial operations such as minimum spanning tree construction and
  local recursive grouping; the parameter learning is based on the method of moments
  and on tensor decompositions. Our method  is guaranteed to correctly recover the
  unknown tree structure and the model parameters with low sample complexity for the
  class of linear multivariate latent tree models which includes discrete and Gaussian
  distributions, and Gaussian mixtures. Our bulk asynchronous parallel algorithm is
  implemented in parallel and scales logarithmically with the number of variables
  and linearly with dimensionality of each variable. '
