title: Revisiting Reweighted Wake-Sleep for Models with Stochastic Control Flow
abstract: Stochastic control-flow models (SCFMs) are a class of generative models
  that involve branching on choices from discrete random variables. Amortized gradient-based
  learning of SCFMs is challenging as most approaches targeting discrete variables
  rely on their continuous relaxationsâ€”which can be intractable in SCFMs, as branching
  on relaxations requires evaluating all (exponentially many) branching paths. Tractable
  alternatives mainly combine REINFORCE with complex control-variate schemes to improve
  the variance of naive estimators. Here, we revisit the reweighted wake-sleep (RWS)
  [5] algorithm, and through extensive evaluations, show that it outperforms current
  state-of-the-art methods in learning SCFMs. Further, in contrast to the importance
  weighted autoencoder, we observe that RWS learns better models and inference networks
  with increasing numbers of particles. Our results suggest that RWS is a competitive,
  often preferable, alternative for learning SCFMs.
