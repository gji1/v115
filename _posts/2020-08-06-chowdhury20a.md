title: Randomized Iterative Algorithms for Fisher Discriminant Analysis
abstract: Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) is a widely used method for classification
  and dimensionality reduction. When the number of predictor variables greatly exceeds
  the number of observations, one of the alternatives for conventional FDA is regularized
  Fisher discriminant analysis (RFDA). In this paper, we present a simple, iterative,
  sketching-based algorithm for RFDA that comes with provable accuracy guarantees
  when compared to the conventional approach.  Our analysis builds upon two simple
  structural results that boil down to randomized matrix multiplication, a fundamental
  and well-understood primitive of randomized linear algebra. We analyze the behavior
  of RFDA when leverage scores and ridge leverage scores are used to select predictor
  variables, and prove that accurate approximations can be achieved by a sample whose
  size depends on the effective degrees of freedom of the RFDA problem. Our results
  yield significant improvements over existing approaches and our empirical evaluations
  support our theoretical analyses.
