title: Learnability for the Information Bottleneck
abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) method (Tishby et al. (2000)) provides an
  insightful and principled approach for balancing compression and prediction for
  representation learning. The IB objective I (X ; Z ) − βI(Y ; Z) employs a Lagrange
  multiplier β to tune this trade-off. However, in practice, not only is β chosen
  empirically without theoretical guidance, there is also a lack of theoretical understanding
  between β, learnability, the intrinsic nature of the dataset and model capacity.
  In this paper, we show that if β is improperly chosen, learning cannot happen –
  the trivial representation P(Z|X) = P(Z) becomes the global minimum of the IB objective.
  We show how this can be avoided, by identifying a sharp phase transition between
  the unlearnable and the learnable which arises as β is varied. This phase transition
  defines the concept of IB-Learnability. We prove several sufficient conditions for
  IB-Learnability, which provides theoretical guidance for choosing a good β. We further
  show that IB-learnability is determined by the largest confident, typical, and imbalanced
  subset of the examples (the conspicuous subset), and discuss its relation with model
  capacity. We give practical algorithms to estimate the minimum β for a given dataset.
  We also empirically demonstrate our theoretical conditions with analyses of synthetic
  datasets, MNIST, and CIFAR10.
