title: Randomized Value Functions via Multiplicative Normalizing Flows
abstract: 'Randomized value functions offer a promising approach towards the challenge
  of efficient exploration in complex environments with high dimensional state and
  action spaces. Unlike traditional point estimate methods, randomized value functions
  maintain a posterior distribution over action-space values. This prevents the agentâ€™s
  behavior policy from prematurely exploiting early estimates and falling into local
  optima. In this work, we leverage recent advances in variational Bayesian neural
  networks and combine these with traditional Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic
  Policy Gradient (DDPG) to achieve randomized value functions for high-dimensional
  domains. In particular, we augment DQN and DDPG with multiplicative normalizing
  flows in order to track a rich approximate posterior distribution over the parameters
  of the value function. This allows the agent to perform approximate Thompson sampling
  in a computationally efficient manner via stochastic gradient methods. We demonstrate
  the benefits  of our approach through an empirical comparison in high dimensional
  environments. '
