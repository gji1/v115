title: 'Multi-Class Gaussian Process Classification Made Conjugate: Efficient Inference
  via Data Augmentation'
abstract: 'We propose a new scalable multi-class Gaussian process classification approach
  building on a novel modified softmax likelihood function. The new likelihood has
  two benefits: it leads to well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and allows for an
  efficient latent variable augmentation. The augmented model has the advantage that
  it is conditionally conjugate leading to a fast variational inference method via
  block coordinate ascent updates. Previous approaches suffered from a trade-off between
  uncertainty calibration and speed. Our experiments show that our method leads to
  well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and competitive predictive performance while
  being up to two orders faster than the state of the art.'
