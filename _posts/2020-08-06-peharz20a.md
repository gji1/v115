title: 'Random Sum-Product Networks: A Simple and Effective Approach to Probabilistic
  Deep Learning'
abstract: Sum-product networks (SPNs) are expressive probabilistic models with a rich
  set of exact and efficient inference routines. However, in order to guarantee exact
  inference, they require specific structural constraints, which complicate learning
  SPNs from data. Thereby, most SPN structure learners proposed so far are tedious
  to tune, do not scale easily, and are not easily integrated with deep learning frameworks.
  In this paper, we follow a simple “deep learning” approach, by generating unspecialized
  random structures, scalable to millions of parameters, and subsequently applying
  GPU-based optimization. Somewhat surprisingly, our models often perform on par with
  state-of-the-art SPN structure learners and deep neural networks on a diverse range
  of generative and discriminative scenarios. At the same time, our models yield well-calibrated
  uncertainties, and stand out among most deep generative and discriminative models
  in being robust to missing features and being able to detect anomalies.
