title: Cubic Regularization with Momentum for Nonconvex Optimization
abstract: Momentum is a popular technique to accelerate the convergence in practical
  training, and its impact on convergence guarantee has been well-studied for first-order
  algorithms. However, such a successful acceleration technique has not yet been proposed
  for second-order algorithms in nonconvex optimization. In this paper, we apply the
  momentum scheme to cubic regularized (CR) Newton’s method and explore the potential
  for acceleration. Our numerical experiments on various nonconvex optimization problems
  demonstrate that the momentum scheme can substantially facilitate the convergence
  of cubic regularization, and perform even better than the Nesterov’s acceleration
  scheme for CR. Theoretically, we prove that CR under momentum achieves the best
  possible convergence rate to a second-order stationary point for nonconvex optimization.
  Moreover, we study the proposed algorithm for solving problems satisfying an error
  bound condition and establish a local quadratic convergence rate. Then, particularly
  for finite-sum problems, we show that the proposed algorithm can allow computational
  inexactness that reduces the overall sample complexity without degrading the convergence
  rate.
