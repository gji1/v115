title: 'Belief Propagation: Accurate Marginals or Accurate Partition Function – Where
  is the Difference?'
abstract: We analyze belief propagation on patch potential models – these are attractive
  models with varying local potentials – obtain all of the possibly many fixed points,
  and gather novel insights into belief propagation’s properties. In particular, we
  observe and theoretically explain several regions in the parameter space that behave
  fundamentally different. We specify and elaborate on one specific region that, despite
  the existence of multiple fixed points, is relatively well behaved and provides
  insights into the relationship between the accuracy of the marginals and the partition
  function. We demonstrate the inexistence of a principle relationship between both
  quantities and provide sufficient conditions for a fixed point to be optimal with
  respect to approximating both the marginals and the partition function.
