title: Online Factorization and Partition of Complex Networks by Random Walk
abstract: Finding the reduced-dimensional structure is critical to understanding complex
  networks. Existing approaches such as spectral clustering are applicable only when
  the full network is explicitly observed. In this paper, we focus on the online factorization
  and partition of implicit large lumpable networks based on observations from an
  associated random walk. We formulate this into a nonconvex stochastic factorization
  problem and propose an efficient and scalable stochastic generalized Hebbian algorithm
  (GHA). The algorithm is able to process random walk data in a streaming fashion
  and learn a low-dimensional representation for each vertex. By applying a diffusion
  approximation analysis, we show that the continuous-time limiting process of the
  stochastic algorithm converges globally to the “principal components” of the Markov
  chain. We also establish a finite-sample error bound that matches the nonimprovable
  state-of-art result for online factorization. Once learned the low-dimensional state
  representations, we further apply clustering techniques to recover the network partition.
  We show that when the associated Markov process is lumpable, one can recover the
  partition exactly with high probability given sufficient data. We apply the proposed
  approach to model the traffic flow of Manhattan as city-wide random walks. By using
  our algorithm to analyze the taxi trip data, we discover a latent partition of the
  Manhattan city that closely matches the traffic dynamics.
