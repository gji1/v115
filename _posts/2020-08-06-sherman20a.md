title: Intervening on Network Ties
abstract: 'A foundational tool for making causal inferences is the emulation of randomized
  control trials via variable interventions. This approach has been applied to a wide
  variety of contexts, from health to economics [3, 6]. Variable interventions have
  long been studied in independent and identically distributed (iid) data contexts,
  but recently non-iid settings, such as networks with interacting agents [8, 17,
  28] have attracted interest. In this paper, we propose a type of structural intervention
  [12] relevant in network contexts: the network intervention. Rather than estimating
  the effect of changing variables, we consider changes to social network structure
  resulting from creation or severance of ties between agents. We define the individual
  participant and average bystander effects for these interventions and describe identification
  criteria. We then prove a series of theoretical results that show existing identification
  theory obtains minimally KL-divergent distributions corresponding to network interventions.
  Finally, we demonstrate estimation of effects of network interventions via a simulation
  study.'
