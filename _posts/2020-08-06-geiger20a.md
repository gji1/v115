title: Coordinating Users of Shared Facilities via Data-driven Predictive Assistants
  and Game Theory
abstract: 'We study data-driven assistants that provide congestion forecasts to users
  of shared facilities (roads, cafeterias, etc.), to support coordination between
  them, and increase efficiency of such collective systems. Key questions are: (1)
  when and how much can (accurate) predictions help for coordination, and (2) which
  assistant algorithms reach optimal predictions? First we lay conceptual ground for
  this setting where user preferences are a priori unknown and predictions influence
  outcomes. Addressing (1), we establish conditions under which self-fulfilling prophecies,
  i.e., “perfect” (probabilistic) predictions of what will happen, solve the coordination
  problem in the gametheoretic sense of selecting a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE).
  Next we prove that such prophecies exist even in large-scale settings where only
  aggregated statistics about users are available. This entails a new (nonatomic)
  BNE existence result. Addressing (2), we propose two assistant algorithms that sequentially
  learn from users’ reactions, together with optimality/ convergence guarantees. We
  validate one of them in a large real-world experiment.'
