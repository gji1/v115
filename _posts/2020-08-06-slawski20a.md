title: A Sparse Representation-Based Approach to Linear Regression with Partially
  Shuffled Labels
abstract: 'Several recent papers have discussed a modification of linear regression
  in which the correspondence between input variables and labels is missing or erroneous,
  referred to as "Linear Regression with Unknown Permutation",  or "Linear Regression
  with Shuffled Data". Prior studies of this setup have shed light on the associated
  statistical limits. However, practical and well-founded approaches that overcome
  the computational challenges of the setup are still scarce. In this paper, we translate
  the problem of linear regression with unknown permutation to a robust subspace recovery
  problem, or alternatively, outlier recovery problem. Outliers correspond to mismatched
  data, and a specific sparse representation of the data is used to detect the outliers.
  The proposed approach requires at least a reasonably large fraction (but potentially
  significantly less than 50%) of the response-predictor pairs to be in correct correspondence.
  This assumption is often justified, e.g., if record linkage based on additional
  contextual information is sufficiently accurate to enable correct matching of such
  fraction of the data. It turns out that in this situation, estimation of the regression
  parameter on the one hand and recovery of the underlying permutation on the other
  hand can be decoupled so that the computational hardness associated with the latter
  can be sidestepped. '
