title: Embarrassingly Parallel MCMC using Deep Invertible Transformations
abstract: While MCMC methods have become a main work-horse for Bayesian inference,
  scaling them to large distributed datasets is still a challenge. Embarrassingly
  parallel MCMC strategies take a divide-and-conquer stance to achieve this by writing
  the target posterior as a product of subposteriors, running MCMC for each of them
  in parallel and subsequently combining the results. The challenge then lies in devising
  efficient aggregation strategies. Current strategies  trade-off between approximation
  quality, and costs of communication and computation. In this work, we introduce
  a novel method that addresses these issues simultaneously. Our key insight is to
  introduce a deep invertible transformation to approximate each of the subposteriors.
  These approximations can be made accurate even for complex distributions and serve
  as intermediate representations, keeping the total communication cost limited. Moreover,
  they enable us to sample from the product of the subposteriors using an efficient
  and stable importance sampling scheme. We demonstrate that the approach outperforms
  available state-of-the-art methods in a range of challenging scenarios, including
  high-dimensional and heterogeneous subposteriors.
