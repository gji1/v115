title: Low Frequency Adversarial Perturbation
abstract: Adversarial images aim to change a target modelâ€™s decision by minimally
  perturbing a target image. In the black-box setting, the absence of gradient information
  often renders this search problem costly in terms of query complexity. In this paper
  we propose to restrict the search for adversarial images to a low frequency domain.
  This approach is readily compatible with many existing black-box attack frameworks
  and consistently reduces their query cost by 2 to 4 times. Further, we can circumvent
  image transformation defenses even when both the model and the defense strategy
  are unknown. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by fooling the
  Google Cloud Vision platform with an unprecedented low number of model queries.
