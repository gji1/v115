title: Random Clique Covers for Graphs with Local Density and Global Sparsity
abstract: Large real-world graphs tend to be sparse, but they often contain many densely
  connected subgraphs and exhibit high clustering coefficients. While recent random
  graph models can capture this sparsity, they ignore the local density, or vice versa.
  We develop a Bayesian nonparametric graph model based on random edge clique covers,
  and show that this model can capture power law degree distribution, global sparsity
  and non-vanishing local clustering coefficient. This distribution can be used directly
  as a prior on observed graphs, or as part of a hierarchical Bayesian model for inferring
  latent graph structures.
