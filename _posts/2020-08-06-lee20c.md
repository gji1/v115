title: A Weighted Mini-Bucket Bound for Solving Influence Diagram
abstract: Influence diagrams provide a modeling and inference framework for sequential
  decision problems, representing the probabilistic knowledge by a Bayesian network
  and the preferences of an agent by utility functions over the random variables and
  decision variables.  The time and space complexity of computing the maximum expected
  utility (MEU) and its maximizing policy are exponential in the induced width of
  the underlying graphical model, which is often prohibitively large. In this paper,
  we develop a weighted mini-bucket approach for bounding the MEU.  These bounds can
  be used as a stand-alone approximation that can be improved as a function of a controlling
  i-bound parameter, or as a heuristic function to guide subsequent search.  We evaluate
  the scheme empirically against the current state of the art, illustrating its potential.
