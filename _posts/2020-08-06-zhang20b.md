title: Bayesian Optimization with Binary Auxiliary Information
abstract: 'This paper presents novel mixed-type Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms
  to accelerate the optimization of a target objective function by exploiting correlated
  auxiliary information of binary type that can be more cheaply obtained, such as
  in policy search for reinforcement learning and hyperparameter tuning of machine
  learning models with early stopping. To achieve this, we first propose a mixed-type
  multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) to jointly model the continuous target function
  and binary auxiliary functions. Then, we propose information-based acquisition functions
  such as mixed-type entropy search (MT-ES) and mixed-type predictive ES (MT-PES)
  for mixed-type BO based on the MOGP predictive belief of the target and auxiliary
  functions. The exact acquisition functions of MT-ES and MT-PES cannot be computed
  in closed form and need to be approximated. We derive an efficient approximation
  of MT-PES via a novel mixed-type random features approximation of the MOGP model
  whose cross-correlation structure between the target and auxiliary functions can
  be exploited for improving the belief of the global target maximizer using the observations
  from evaluating these functions. We also propose new practical constraints to relate
  the global target maximizer to the binary auxiliary functions. We empirically evaluate
  the performance of MT-ES and MT-PES with synthetic and real-world experiments. '
