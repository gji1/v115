title: One-Shot Marginal MAP Inference in Markov Random Fields
abstract: Statistical inference in Markov random fields (MRFs) is NP-hard in all but
  the simplest of cases.  As a result, many algorithms, particularly in the case of
  discrete random variables, have been developed to perform approximate inference
  in practice.  However, most of these methods scale poorly, cannot be applied to
  continuous random variables, or are too slow to be used in situations that call
  for repeated statistical inference on the same model.  In this work, we propose
  a novel variational inference strategy that is flexible enough to handle both continuous
  and discrete random variables, efficient enough to be able to handle repeated statistical
  inferences, and scalable enough, via modern GPUs, to be practical on MRFs with hundreds
  of thousands of random variables.  We prove that our approach overcomes weaknesses
  of the current approaches and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both synthetic
  models and real-world applications.
