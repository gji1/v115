title: On the Relationship Between Satisfiability and Markov Decision Processes
abstract: 'Stochastic satisfiability (SSAT) and decision-theoretic planning in finite
  horizon partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are both PSPACE-Complete.
  We describe constructive reductions between SSAT and flat POMDPs that open the door
  to comparisons and future cross-fertilization between the solution techniques of
  those problems.  We also propose a new SSAT solver called Prime that incorporates
  recent advances from the SAT and #SAT literature.  Using our reduction from POMDP
  to SSAT, we demonstrate the competitiveness of Prime on finite horizon POMDP problems.'
