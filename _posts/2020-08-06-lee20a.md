title: Towards Robust Relational Causal Discovery
abstract: We consider the problem of learning causal relationships from relational
  data. Existing approaches rely on queries to a relational conditional independence
  (RCI) oracle to establish and orient causal relations in such a setting. In practice,
  queries to a RCI oracle have to be replaced by reliable tests for RCI against available
  data. Relational data present several unique challenges in testing for RCI. We study
  the conditions under which traditional iid-based CI tests yield reliable answers
  to RCI queries against relational data. We show how to conduct CI tests against
  relational data to robustly recover the underlying relational causal structure.
  Results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
