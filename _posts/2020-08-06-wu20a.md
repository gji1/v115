title: Practical Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning
abstract: Bayesian optimization is popular for optimizing time-consuming black-box
  objectives.  Nonetheless, for hyperparameter tuning in deep neural networks, the
  time required to evaluate the validation error for even a few hyperparameter settings
  remains a bottleneck.  Multi-fidelity optimization promises relief using cheaper
  proxies to such objectives —  for example, validation error for a network trained
  using a subset of the training points or fewer iterations than required for convergence.  We
  propose a highly flexible and practical approach to multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization,
  focused on efficiently optimizing hyperparameters for iteratively trained supervised
  learning models.  We introduce a new acquisition function, the trace-aware knowledge-gradient,
  which efficiently leverages both multiple continuous fidelity controls and trace
  observations — values of the objective at a sequence of fidelities, available when
  varying fidelity using training iterations.  We provide a provably convergent method
  for optimizing our acquisition function and show it outperforms state-of-the-art
  alternatives for  hyperparameter tuning of deep neural networks and large-scale
  kernel learning.
