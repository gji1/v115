title: 'Markov Logic Networks for Knowledge Base Completion: A Theoretical Analysis
  Under the MCAR Assumption'
abstract: We study the following question. We are given a knowledge base in which
  some facts are missing. We learn the weights of a Markov logic network using maximum
  likelihood estimation on this knowledge base and then use the learned Markov logic
  network to predict the missing facts. Assuming that the facts are missing independently
  and with the same probability, can we say that this approach is consistent in some
  precise sense? This is a non-trivial question because we are learning from only
  one training example. In this paper we show that the answer to this question is
  positive.
