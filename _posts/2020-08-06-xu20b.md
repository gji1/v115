title: Learning with Non-Convex Truncated Losses by SGD
abstract: Learning with a convex loss function has been a dominating paradigm for
  many years. It remains an interesting question how non-convex loss functions help
  improve the generalization of learning with broad applicability. In this paper,
  we study a family of objective functions  formed by truncating traditional loss
  functions, which  is applicable to both shallow learning and deep learning. Truncating
  loss functions has  potential to be less vulnerable and more robust to large noise
  in observations that could be adversarial. More importantly, it is a generic technique
  without assuming the knowledge of  noise distribution. To justify non-convex learning
  with truncated losses, we establish excess risk bounds of empirical risk minimization
  based on truncated losses for heavy-tailed output, and statistical error of an approximate
  stationary point found by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. Our experiments
  for shallow and deep learning for regression with outliers, corrupted data and heavy-tailed
  noise further justify the proposed method.
