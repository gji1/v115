title: Dynamic Trip-Vehicle Dispatch with Scheduled and On-Demand Requests
abstract: Transportation service providers that dispatch drivers and vehicles to riders
  start to support both on-demand ride requests posted in real time and rides scheduled
  in advance, leading to new challenges which, to the best of our knowledge, have
  not been addressed by existing works. To fill the gap, we design novel trip-vehicle
  dispatch algorithms to handle both types of requests while taking into account an
  estimated request distribution of on-demand requests. At the core of the algorithms
  is the newly proposed Constrained Spatio-Temporal value function (CST-function),
  which is polynomial-time computable and represents the expected value a vehicle
  could gain with the constraint that it needs to arrive at a specific location at
  a given time. Built upon CST-function, we design a randomized best-fit algorithm
  for scheduled requests and an online planning algorithm for on-demand requests given
  the scheduled requests as constraints. We evaluate the algorithms through extensive
  experiments on a real-world dataset of an online ride-hailing platform.
