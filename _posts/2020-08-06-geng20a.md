title: Joint Nonparametric Precision Matrix Estimation with Confounding
abstract: We consider the problem of precision matrix estimation where, due to extraneous
  confounding of the underlying precision matrix, the data are independent but not
  identically distributed. While such confounding occurs in many scientific problems,
  our approach is inspired by recent neuroscientific research suggesting that brain
  function, as measured using functional magnetic resonance imagine (fMRI), is susceptible
  to confounding by physiological noise such as breathing and subject motion. Following
  the scientific motivation, we propose a graphical model, which in turn motivates
  a joint nonparametric estimator.  We provide theoretical guarantees for the consistency
  and the convergence rate of the proposed estimator. In addition, we demonstrate
  that the optimization of the proposed estimator can be transformed into a series
  of linear programming problems, and thus be efficiently solved in parallel. Empirical
  results are presented using simulated and real brain imaging data, which suggest
  that our approach improves precision matrix estimation, as compared to baselines,
  when confounding is present.
