title: 'The Incomplete Rosetta Stone problem: Identifiability results for Multi-view
  Nonlinear ICA'
abstract: 'We consider the problem of recovering a common latent source with independent
  components from multiple views. This applies to settings in which a variable is
  measured with multiple experimental modalities, and where the goal is to synthesize
  the disparate measurements into a single unified representation. We consider the
  case that the observed views are a nonlinear mixing of component-wise corruptions
  of the sources. When the views are considered separately, this reduces to nonlinear
  Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for which it is provably impossible to undo
  the mixing. We present novel identifiability proofs that this is possible when the
  multiple views are considered jointly, showing that the mixing can theoretically
  be undone using function approximators such as deep neural networks. In contrast
  to known identifiability results for nonlinear ICA, we prove that independent latent
  sources with arbitrary mixing can be recovered as long as multiple, sufficiently
  different noisy views are available. '
