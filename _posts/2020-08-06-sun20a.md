title: Fisher-Bures Adversary Graph Convolutional Networks
abstract: 'In a graph convolutional network, we assume that the graph $G$ is generated
  wrt some observation noise. During learning, we make small random perturbations
  $\Delta{}G$ of the graph and try to improve generalization. Based on quantum information
  geometry, $\Delta{}G$ can be characterized by the eigendecomposition of the graph
  Laplacian matrix. We try to minimize the loss wrt the perturbed $G+\Delta{G}$ while
  making $\Delta{G}$ to be effective in terms of the Fisher information of the neural
  network. Our proposed model can consistently improve graph convolutional networks
  on semi-supervised node classification tasks with reasonable computational overhead.
  We present three different geometries on the manifold of graphs: the intrinsic geometry
  measures the information theoretic dynamics of a graph; the extrinsic geometry characterizes
  how such dynamics can affect externally a graph neural network; the embedding geometry
  is for measuring node embeddings. These new analytical tools are useful in developing
  a good understanding of graph neural networks and fostering new techniques.'
