title: Efficient Planning Under Uncertainty with Incremental Refinement
abstract: Online planning under uncertainty on robots and similar agents has very
  strict performance requirements in order to achieve reasonable behavior in complex
  domains with limited resources.  The underlying process of decision-making and information
  gathering is correctly modeled by POMDP’s, but their complexity makes many interesting
  and challenging problems virtually intractable.  We address this issue by introducing
  a method to estimate relevance values for elements of a planning domain, that allow
  an agent to focus on promising features.  This approach reduces the effective dimensionality
  of problems, allowing an agent to plan faster and collect higher rewards.  Experimental
  validation was performed on two challenging POMDP’s that resemble real-world robotic
  task planning, where it is crucial to interleave planning and acting in an efficient
  manner.
