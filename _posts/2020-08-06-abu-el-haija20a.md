title: 'N-GCN: Multi-scale Graph Convolution for Semi-supervised Node Classification'
abstract: 'Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown significant improvements
  in semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data. Concurrently, unsupervised
  learning of graph embeddings has benefited from the information contained in random
  walks. In this paper, we propose a model: Network of GCNs (N-GCN), which marries
  these two lines of work. At its core, N-GCN trains multiple instances of GCNs over
  node pairs discovered at different distances in random walks, and learns a combination
  of the instance outputs which optimizes the classification objective. Our experiments
  show that our proposed N-GCN model improves state-of-the-art baselines on all of
  the challenging node classification tasks we consider: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and
  PPI. In addition, our proposed method has other desirable properties, including
  generalization to recently proposed semi-supervised learning methods such as GraphSAGE,
  allowing us to propose N-SAGE, and resilience to adversarial input perturbations.'
