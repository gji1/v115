title: Probabilistic Programming for Birth-Death Models of Evolution Using an Alive
  Particle Filter with Delayed Sampling
abstract: 'We consider probabilistic programming for birth-death models of evolution
  and introduce a new widely-applicable inference method that combines an extension
  of the alive particle filter (APF) with automatic Rao-Blackwellization via delayed
  sampling. Birth-death models of evolution are an important family of phylogenetic
  models of the diversification processes that lead to evolutionary trees. Probabilistic
  programming languages (PPLs) give phylogeneticists a new and exciting tool: their
  models can be implemented as probabilistic programs with just a basic knowledge
  of programming. The general inference methods in PPLs reduce the need for external
  experts, allow quick prototyping and testing, and accelerate the development and
  deployment of new models. We show how these birth-death models can be implemented
  as simple programs in existing PPLs, and demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
  inference method for such models. For the popular BiSSE model the method yields
  an increase of the effective sample size and the conditional acceptance rate by
  a factor of 30 in comparison with a standard bootstrap particle filter. Although
  concentrating on phylogenetics, the extended APF is a general inference method that
  shows its strength in situations where particles are often assigned zero weight.
  In the case when the weights are always positive, the extra cost of using the APF
  rather than the bootstrap particle filter is negligible, making our method a suitable
  drop-in replacement for the bootstrap particle filter in probabilistic programming
  inference.'
