title: Active Multi-Information Source Bayesian Quadrature
abstract: Bayesian quadrature (BQ) is a sample-efficient probabilistic numerical method
  to solve integrals of expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, yet so far, active
  BQ learning schemes focus merely on the integrand itself as information source,
  and do not allow for information transfer from cheaper, related functions. Here,
  we set the scene for active learning in BQ when multiple related information sources
  of variable cost (in input and source) are accessible. This setting arises for example
  when evaluating the integrand requires a complex simulation to be run that can be
  approximated by simulating at lower levels of sophistication and at lesser expense.
  We construct meaningful cost-sensitive multi-source acquisition-rates as an extension
  to common utility functions from vanilla BQ (VBQ), and discuss pitfalls that arise
  from blindly generalizing. In proof-of-concept experiments we scrutinize the behavior
  of our generalized acquisition functions. On an epidemiological model, we demonstrate
  that active multi-source BQ (AMS-BQ) is more cost-efficient than VBQ in learning
  the integral to a good accuracy.
