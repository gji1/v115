title: 'On Fast Convergence of Proximal Algorithms for SQRT-Lasso Optimization: Don’t
  Worry About its Nonsmooth Loss Function'
abstract: Many machine learning techniques sacrifice convenient computational structures
  to gain estimation robustness and modeling flexibility. However, by exploring the
  modeling structures, we find these “sacrifices” do not always require more computational
  efforts. To shed light on such a “free-lunch” phenomenon, we study the square-root-Lasso
  (SQRT-Lasso) type regression problem. Specifically, we show that the nonsmooth loss
  functions of SQRT-Lasso type regression ease tuning effort and gain adaptivity to
  inhomogeneous noise, but is not necessarily more challenging than Lasso in computation.
  We can directly apply proximal algorithms (e.g. proximal gradient descent, proximal
  Newton, and proximal quasi-Newton algorithms) without worrying about the nonsmoothness
  of the loss function. Theoretically, we prove that the proximal algorithms combined
  with the pathwise optimization scheme enjoy fast convergence guarantees with high
  probability. Numerical results are provided to support our theory.
