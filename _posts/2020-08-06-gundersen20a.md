title: End-to-end Training of Deep Probabilistic CCA on Paired Biomedical Observations
abstract: Medical pathology images are visually evaluated by experts for disease diagnosis,
  but the connection between image features and the state of the cells in an image
  is typically unknown. To understand this relationship, we develop a multimodal modeling
  and inference framework that estimates shared latent structure of joint gene expression
  levels and medical image features. Our method is built around probabilistic canonical
  correlation analysis (PCCA), which is fit to image embeddings that are learned using
  convolutional neural networks and linear embeddings of paired gene expression data.
  Using a differentiable take on the EM algorithm, we train the model end-to-end so
  that the PCCA and neural network parameters are estimated simultaneously. We demonstrate
  the utility of this method in constructing image features that are predictive of
  gene expression levels on simulated data and the Genotype-Tissue Expression data.
  We demonstrate that the latent variables are interpretable by disentangling the
  latent subspace through shared and modality-specific views.
