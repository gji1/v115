title: Finding Minimal d-separators in Linear Time and Applications
abstract: 'The study of graphical causal models is fundamentally the study of separations
  and conditional independences. We provide linear time algorithms for two graphical
  primitives: to test, if a given set is a minimal d-separator, and to find a minimal
  d-separator in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), completed partially directed acyclic
  graphs (CPDAGs) and restricted chain graphs (RCGs) as well as minimal m-separators
  in ancestral graphs (AGs). These algorithms improve the runtime of the best previously
  known algorithms for minimal separators  that are based on moralization and thus
  require quadratic time to construct and handle the moral graph. (Minimal) separating
  sets have important applications like finding (minimal) covariate adjustment sets
  or conditional instrumental variables.'
