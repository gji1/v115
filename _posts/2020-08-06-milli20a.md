title: Literal or Pedagogic Human? Analyzing Human Model Misspecification in Objective
  Learning
abstract: 'It is incredibly easy for a system designer to misspecify the objective
  for an autonomous system (â€œrobot"), thus motivating the desire to have the robot
  learn the objective from human behavior instead.  Recent work has suggested that
  people have an interest in the robot performing well, and will thus behave pedagogically,
  choosing actions that are informative to the robot. In turn, robots benefit from
  interpreting the behavior by accounting for this pedagogy. In this work, we focus
  on misspecification: we argue that robots might not know whether people are being
  pedagogic or literal and that it is important to ask which assumption is safer to
  make. We cast objective learning into the more general form of a common-payoff game
  between the robot and human, and prove that in any such game literal interpretation
  is more robust to misspecification. Experiments with human data support our theoretical
  results and point to the sensitivity of the pedagogic assumption.'
