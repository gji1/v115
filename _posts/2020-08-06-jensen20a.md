title: Object Conditioning for Causal Inference
abstract: We describe and analyze a form of conditioning that is widely applied within
  social science and applied statistics but that is virtually unknown within causal
  graphical models. This approach, which we term object conditioning, can adjust for
  the effects of latent confounders and yet avoid the pitfall of conditioning on colliders.
  We describe object conditioning using plate models and show how its probabilistic
  implications can be explained using the property of exchangeability. We show that
  several seemingly obvious interpretations of object conditioning are insufficient
  to describe its probabilistic implications.  Finally, we use object conditioning
  to describe and unify key aspects of a diverse set of techniques for causal inference,
  including within-subjects designs, difference-in-differences designs, and interrupted
  time-series designs.
