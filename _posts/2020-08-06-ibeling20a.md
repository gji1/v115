title: On Open-Universe Causal Reasoning
abstract: We extend two kinds of causal models, structural equation models and simulation
  models, to infinite variable spaces. This enables a semantics of counterfactuals,
  calculus of intervention, and axiomatization of causal reasoning for rich, expressive
  generative models—including those in which a causal representation exists only implicitly—in
  an open-universe setting.  Further, we show that under suitable restrictions the
  two kinds of models are equivalent, perhaps surprisingly since their conditional
  logics differ substantially in the general case. We give a series of complete axiomatizations
  in which the open-universe nature of the setting is seen to be essential.
