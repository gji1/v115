title: On First-Order Bounds, Variance and Gap-Dependent Bounds for Adversarial Bandits
abstract: We make three contributions to the theory of k-armed adversarial bandits.
  First, we prove a first-order bound for a modified variant of the INF strategy by
  Audibert and Bubeck [2009], without sacrificing worst case optimality or modifying
  the loss estimators. Second, we provide a variance analysis for algorithms based
  on follow the regularised leader, showing that without adaptation the variance of
  the regret is typically {\Omega}(n^2) where n is the horizon. Finally, we study
  bounds that depend on the degree of separation of the arms, generalising the results
  by Cowan and Katehakis [2015] from the stochastic setting to the adversarial and
  improving the result of Seldin and Slivkins [2014] by a factor of log(n)/log(log(n)).
