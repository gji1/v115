title: Problem-dependent Regret Bounds for Online Learning with Feedback Graphs
abstract: This paper addresses the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with an undirected
  feedback graph. We devise a UCB-based algorithm, UCB-NE, to provide a problem-dependent
  regret bound that depends on a clique covering. Our algorithm obtains regret which
  provably scales linearly with the clique covering number. Additionally, we provide
  problem-dependent regret bounds for a Thompson Sampling-based algorithm, TS-N, where
  again the bounds are linear in the clique covering number. Finally, we present experimental
  results to see how UCB-NE, TS-N, and a few related algorithms perform practically.
