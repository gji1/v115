title: How to Exploit Structure while Solving Weighted Model Integration Problems
abstract: 'Weighted model counting (WMC) is a state-of-the-art technique for probabilistic
  inference in discrete domains. WMC has recently been extended towards weighted model
  integration (WMI) in order to handle discrete and continuous distributions alike.
  While a number of WMI solvers have been introduced, their relationships, strengths
  and weaknesses are not yet well understood. WMI solving consists of two sub-problems:
  1) finding convex polytopes; and 2) integrating over them efficiently. We formalize
  the first step as $\lambda$-SMT and discuss what strategies solvers apply to solve
  both the $\lambda$-SMT and the integration problem. This formalization allows us
  to compare state-of-the-art solvers and their behaviour across different types of
  WMI problems. Moreover, we identify factorizability of WMI problems as a key property
  that emerges in the context of probabilistic programming. Problems that can be factorized
  can be solved more efficiently. However, current solvers exploiting this property
  restrict themselves to WMI problems with univariate conditions and fully factorizable
  weight functions. We introduce a new algorithm, F-XSDD, that lifts these restrictions
  and can exploit factorizability in WMI problems with multivariate conditions and
  partially factorizable weight functions. Through an empirical evaluation, we show
  the effectiveness of our approach.'
