title: 'CCMI : Classifier based Conditional Mutual Information Estimation'
abstract: Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is a measure of conditional dependence
  between random variables X and Y, given another random variable Z. It can be used
  to quantify conditional dependence among variables in many data-driven inference
  problems such as graphical models, causal learning, feature selection and time-series
  analysis. While k-nearest neighbor (kNN) based estimators as well as kernel-based
  methods have been widely used for CMI estimation, they suffer severely from the
  curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we leverage advances in classifiers and
  generative models to design methods for CMI estimation. Specifically, we introduce
  an estimator for KL-Divergence based on the likelihood ratio by training a classifier
  to distinguish the observed joint distribution from the product distribution. We
  then show how to construct several CMI estimators using this basic divergence estimator
  by drawing ideas from conditional generative models. We demonstrate that the estimates
  from our proposed approaches do not degrade in performance with increasing dimension
  and obtain significant improvement over the widely used KSG estimator. Finally,
  as an application of accurate CMI estimation, we use our best estimator for conditional
  independence testing and achieve superior performance than the state-of-the-art
  tester on both simulated and real data-sets.
