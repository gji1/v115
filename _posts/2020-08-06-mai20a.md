title: On Densification for Minwise Hashing
abstract: One Permutation Hashing (OPH) is a significantly more efficient alternative
  to the popular minwise hashing. To produce a sketch of size $k$, OPH requires just
  one hash function whereas the classical minwise hashing requires $k$ hash functions.
  However, OPH does not have the desirable locality sensitive hashing (LSH) property
  that is important for indexing. [Srivastava and Li 2014, ICML]  proposed the novel
  idea of densification to produce LSH sketches from OPH sketches, and gave the first
  densification routine. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition
  for a densification routine to result in LSH sketches when applied to OPH sketches.
  Furthermore, we give a novel densification routine that for every input, takes O($k
  \log k$) time in expectation and achieves better variance than the previous best
  bound obtained by [Srivastava 2017]. The running time of the densification routine
  given in [Srivastava 2017] for worst case inputs is O($k^2$) in expectation.
