title: 'Empirical Mechanism Design: Designing Mechanisms from Data'
abstract: We introduce a methodology for the design of parametric mechanisms, which
  are multiagent systems inhabited by strategic agents, with knobs that can be adjusted
  to achieve specific goals. We assume agents play approximate equilibria, which we
  estimate using the probably approximately correct learning framework. Under this
  assumption, we further learn approximately optimal mechanism parameters. We do this
  theoretically, assuming a finite design space, and heuristically, using Bayesian
  optimization (BO). Our BO algorithm incorporates the noise associated with modern
  concentration inequalities, such as Hoeffdingâ€™s, into the underlying Gaussian process.
  We show experimentally that our search techniques outperform standard baselines
  in a stylized but rich model of advertisement exchanges.
