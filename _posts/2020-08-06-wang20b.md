title: Truly Proximal Policy Optimization
abstract: 'Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most successful deep reinforcement
  learning methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
  challenging tasks. However, its optimization behavior is still far from being fully
  understood. In this paper, we show that PPO could neither strictly restrict the
  probability ratio as it attempts to do nor enforce a well-defined trust region constraint,
  which means that it may still suffer from the risk of performance instability. To
  address this issue, we present an enhanced PPO method, named Trust Region-based
  PPO with Rollback (TR-PPO-RB). Two critical improvements are made in our method:
  1) it adopts a new clipping function to support a rollback behavior to restrict
  the ratio between the new policy and the old one; 2) the triggering condition for
  clipping is replaced with a trust region-based one, which is theoretically justified
  according to the trust region theorem. It seems, by adhering more truly to the “proximal”
  property − restricting the policy within the trust region, the new algorithm improves
  the original PPO on both stability and sample efficiency.'
