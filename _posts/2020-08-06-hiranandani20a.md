title: 'Cascading Linear Submodular Bandits: Accounting for Position Bias and Diversity
  in Online Learning to Rank'
abstract: Online learning, position bias, and diversified retrieval are three crucial
  aspects in designing ranking systems based on user clicks. One simple click model
  which explains the position bias is the cascade model. Many online learning variants
  of the cascade model have been proposed, but none so far captures diversity. Similarly,
  online learning to rank methods which capture diversity do not handle position bias.
  Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel click model, and the associated
  online learning variant to address both position bias and diversified retrieval
  in a unified framework. Despite the objective function not being a standard submodular
  set function, we prove that a greedy-approach is a reasonable approximation. We
  then propose, CascadeLSB, an algorithm whose goal is to recommend K most attractive
  items from a large set of L items with the attractiveness of items being modeled
  as a submodular utility function. We analyze the algorithm and prove a gap-free
  upper bound on its n-step regret. We comprehensively evaluate CascadeLSB on synthetic
  and real datasets, where it  outperforms all the baselines.
