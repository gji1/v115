title: Generating and Sampling Orbits for Lifted Probabilistic Inference
abstract: A key goal in the design of probabilistic inference algorithms is identifying
  and exploit- ing properties of the distribution that make inference tractable. Lifted
  inference algorithms identify symmetry as a property that enables efficient inference
  and seek to scale with the degree of symmetry of a probability model. A limitation
  of existing exact lifted inference techniques is that they do not apply to non-
  relational representations like factor graphs. In this work we provide the first
  example of an exact lifted inference algorithm for arbitrary discrete factor graphs.
  In addition we describe a lifted Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm that provably
  mixes rapidly in the degree of symmetry of the distribution.
