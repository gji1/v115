title: Approximate Inference in Structured Instances with Noisy Categorical Observations
abstract: We study the problem of recovering the latent ground truth labeling of a
  structured instance with categorical random variables in the presence of noisy observations.
  We present a new approximate algorithm for graphs with categorical variables that
  achieves low Hamming error in the presence of noisy vertex and edge observations.
  Our main result shows a logarithmic dependency of the Hamming error to the number
  of categories of the random variables. Our approach draws connections to correlation
  clustering with a fixed number of clusters. Our results generalize the works of
  Globerson et al. (2015) and Foster et al. (2018), who study the hardness of structured
  prediction under binary labels, to the case of categorical labels.
