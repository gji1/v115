title: Variational Sparse Coding
abstract: Unsupervised discovery of interpretable features and controllable generation
  with high-dimensional data are currently major challenges in machine learning, with
  applications in data visualisation, clustering and artificial data synthesis. We
  propose a model based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) in which interpretation
  is induced through latent space sparsity with a mixture of Spike and Slab distributions
  as prior. We derive an evidence lower bound for this model and propose a specific
  training method for recovering disentangled features as sparse elements in latent
  vectors. In our experiments, we demonstrate superior disentanglement performance
  to standard VAE approaches when an estimate of the number of true sources of variation
  is not available and objects display different combinations of attributes. Furthermore,
  the new model provides unique capabilities, such as recovering feature exploitation,
  synthesising samples that share attributes with a given input object and controlling
  both discrete and continuous features upon generation.
