title: 'Adaptivity and Optimality: A Universal Algorithm for  Online Convex Optimization'
abstract: In this paper, we study adaptive online convex optimization, and aim to
  design a universal algorithm that achieves optimal regret bounds for multiple common
  types of loss functions. Existing universal methods are limited in the sense that
  they are optimal for only a subclass of loss functions. To address this limitation,
  we propose a novel online algorithm, namely Maler, which enjoys the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$,
  $O(d\log T)$ and $O(\log T)$ regret bounds for general convex, exponentially concave,
  and strongly convex functions respectively. The essential idea is to run multiple
  types of learning algorithms with different learning rates in parallel, and utilize
  a meta-algorithm to track the best on the fly. Empirical results demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our method.
