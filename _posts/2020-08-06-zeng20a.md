title: Efficient Search-Based Weighted Model Integration
abstract: Weighted model integration (WMI) extends Weighted model counting (WMC) to
  the integration of functions over mixed discrete-continuous domains. It has shown
  tremendous promise for solving inference problems in graphical models and probabilistic
  programming. Yet, state-of-the-art tools for WMI are limited in terms of performance
  and ignore the independence structure that is crucial to improving efficiency. To
  address this limitation, we propose an efficient model integration algorithm for
  theories with tree primal graphs. We exploit the sparse graph structure by using
  search to performing integration. Our algorithm greatly improves the computational
  efficiency on such problems and exploits context-specific independence between variables.
  Experimental results show dramatic speedups compared to existing WMI solvers on
  problems with tree-shaped dependencies.
