title: Reducing Exploration of Dying Arms in Mortal Bandits
abstract: 'Mortal bandits have proven to be extremely useful for providing news article
  recommendations, running automated online advertising campaigns, and for other applications
  where the set of available options changes over time. Previous work on this problem
  showed how to regulate exploration of new arms when they have recently appeared,
  but they do not adapt when the arms are about to disappear. Since in most applications
  we can determine either exactly or approximately when arms will disappear, we can
  leverage this information to improve performance: we should not be exploring arms
  that are about to disappear. We provide adaptations of algorithms, regret bounds,
  and experiments for this study, showing a clear benefit from regulating greed (exploration/exploitation)
  for arms that will soon disappear. We illustrate numerical performance on the Yahoo!
  Front Page Today Module User Click Log Dataset.'
