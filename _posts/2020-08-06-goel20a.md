title: Personalized Peer Truth Serum for Eliciting Multi-Attribute Personal Data
abstract: Several peer consistency mechanisms have been proposed to incentivize agents
  for honestly solving crowdsourcing tasks. These game-theoretic mechanisms evaluate
  the answers provided by an agent based on the correlation with answers provided
  by other agents ("peers") who solve the same tasks. In this paper, we consider the
  problem of eliciting personal attributes (for e.g. body measurements) of the agents.
  Since attributes are personal in nature, the tasks can not be shared between two
  agents. We show for the first time how to extend a peer consistency incentive mechanism,
  the Logarithmic Peer Truth Serum, to this setting for collecting personal attributes.
  When individuals report combinations of multiple personal data attributes, the correlation
  between them can be exploited to find peers. This new mechanism applies, for example,
  to collecting personal health records and other multi-attribute measurements at
  private properties such as smart homes. We provide a theoretical analysis of the
  incentive properties of the new mechanism and show the performance of the mechanism
  on several public datasets, which confirm the theoretical analysis.
