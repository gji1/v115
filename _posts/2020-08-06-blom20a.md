title: 'Beyond Structural Causal Models: Causal Constraints Models'
abstract: Structural Causal Models (SCMs) provide a popular causal modeling framework.
  In this work, we show that SCMs are not flexible enough to give a complete causal
  representation of dynamical systems at equilibrium. Instead, we propose a generalization
  of the notion of an SCM, that we call Causal Constraints Model (CCM), and prove
  that CCMs do capture the causal semantics of such systems. We show how CCMs can
  be constructed from differential equations and initial conditions and we illustrate
  our ideas further on a simple but ubiquitous (bio)chemical reaction. Our framework
  also allows to model functional laws, such as the ideal gas law, in a sensible and
  intuitive way.
