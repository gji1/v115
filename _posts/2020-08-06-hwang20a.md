title: Sampling-free Uncertainty Estimation in Gated Recurrent Units with Applications
  to Normative Modeling in Neuroimaging
abstract: There has recently been a concerted effort to derive mechanisms in vision
  and machine learning systems to offer uncertainty estimates of the predictions they
  make. Clearly, there are enormous benefits to a system that is not only accurate
  but also has a sense for when it is not. Existing proposals center around Bayesian
  interpretations of modern deep architectures - these are effective but can often
  be computationally demanding. We show how classical ideas in the literature on exponential
  families on probabilistic networks provide an excellent starting point to derive
  uncertainty estimates in Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Our proposal directly quantifies
  uncertainty deterministically, without the need for costly sampling-based estimation.
  We show that while uncertainty is quite useful by itself in computer vision and
  machine learning, we also demonstrate that it can play a key role in enabling statistical
  analysis with deep networks in neuroimaging studies with normative modeling methods.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result describing sampling-free uncertainty
  estimation for powerful sequential models such as GRUs.
