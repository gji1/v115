title: Social Reinforcement Learning to Combat Fake News Spread
abstract: In this work, we develop a social reinforcement learning approach to combat
  the spread of fake news. Specifically, we aim to learn an intervention model to
  promote the spread of true news in a social networkâ€”in order to mitigate the impact
  of fake news. We model news diffusion as a Multivariate Hawkes Process (MHP) and
  make interventions that are learnt via policy optimization. The key insight is to
  estimate the response a user will get from the social network upon sharing a post,
  as it indicates her impact on diffusion, and will  thus help in efficient allocation
  of incentive. User responses also depend on political bias and peer influence, which
  we model as a second MHP, interleaving it with the news diffusion process. We evaluate
  our model on semi-synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate that our
  proposed model outperforms other alternatives that do not consider estimates of
  user responses and political bias when learning how to allocate incentives.
