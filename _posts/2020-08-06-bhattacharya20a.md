title: Causal Inference Under Interference And Network Uncertainty
abstract: Classical causal and statistical inference methods typically assume the
  observed data consists of independent realizations. However, in many applications
  this assumption is inappropriate due to a network of dependences between units in
  the data. Methods for estimating causal effects have been developed in the setting
  where the structure of dependence between units is known exactly, but in practice
  there is often substantial uncertainty about the precise network structure. This
  is true, for example, in trial data drawn from vulnerable communities where social
  ties are difficult to query directly. In this paper we combine techniques from the
  structure learning and interference literatures in causal inference, proposing a
  general method for estimating causal effects under data dependence when the structure
  of this dependence is not known a priori. We demonstrate the utility of our method
  on synthetic datasets which exhibit network dependence.
