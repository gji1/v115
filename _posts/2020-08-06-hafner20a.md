title: Noise Contrastive Priors for Functional Uncertainty
abstract: Obtaining reliable uncertainty estimates of neural network predictions is
  a long standing challenge. Bayesian neural networks have been proposed as a solution,
  but it remains open how to specify their prior. In particular, the common practice
  of an independent normal prior in weight space imposes relatively weak constraints
  on the function posterior, allowing it to generalize in unforeseen ways on inputs
  outside of the training distribution. We propose noise contrastive priors (NCPs)
  to obtain reliable uncertainty estimates. The key idea is to train the model to
  output high uncertainty for data points outside of the training distribution. NCPs
  do so using an input prior, which adds noise to the inputs of the current mini batch,
  and an output prior, which is a wide distribution given these inputs. NCPs are compatible
  with any model that can output uncertainty estimates, are easy to scale, and yield
  reliable uncertainty estimates throughout training. Empirically, we show that NCPs
  prevent overfitting outside of the training distribution and result in uncertainty
  estimates that are useful for active learning. We demonstrate the scalability of
  our method on the flight delays data set, where we significantly improve upon previously
  published results.
