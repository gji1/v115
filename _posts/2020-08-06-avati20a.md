title: 'Countdown Regression: Sharp and Calibrated Survival Predictions'
abstract: 'Probabilistic survival predictions (i.e. personalized survival curves)
  from models trained with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) can have high, and
  sometimes unacceptably high variance.  The field of meteorology, where the paradigm
  of maximizing sharpness subject to calibration is popular, has addressed this problem  by
  using scoring rules beyond MLE, such as the Continuous Ranked Probability Score
  (CRPS). In this paper we present the \emph{Survival-CRPS}, a generalization of the
  CRPS to the survival prediction setting, with right-censored and interval-censored
  variants. We evaluate our ideas on the mortality prediction task using two different
  Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sets (STARR and MIMIC-III) covering millions
  of patients, with suitable deep neural network architectures: a Recurrent Neural
  Network (RNN) for STARR and a Fully Connected Network (FCN) for MIMIC-III. We compare
  results between the two different scoring rules while keeping the network architecture
  and data fixed, and show that models trained with Survival-CRPS result in sharper
  predictive distributions compared to those trained by MLE, while still maintaining
  calibration.'
