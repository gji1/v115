title: A Fast Proximal Point Method for Computing Exact Wasserstein Distance
abstract: Wasserstein distance plays increasingly important roles in machine learning,
  stochastic programming and image processing. Major efforts have been under way to
  address its high computational complexity, some leading to approximate or regularized
  variations such as Sinkhorn distance. However, as we will demonstrate, regularized
  variations with large regularization parameter will degradate the performance in
  several important machine learning applications, and small regularization parameter
  will fail due to numerical stability issues with existing algorithms. We address
  this challenge by developing an Inexact Proximal point method for exact Optimal
  Transport problem (IPOT) with the proximal operator approximately evaluated at each
  iteration using projections to the probability simplex. The algorithm (a) converges
  to exact Wasserstein distance with theoretical guarantee and robust regularization
  parameter selection, (b) alleviates numerical stability issue, (c) has similar computational
  complexity to Sinkhorn, and (d) avoids the shrinking problem when applies to generative
  models. Furthermore, a new algorithm is proposed based on IPOT to obtain sharper
  Wasserstein barycenter.
