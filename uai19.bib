title = {Personalized Peer Truth Serum for Eliciting Multi-Attribute Personal Data},
author= {Goel, Naman and Faltings, Boi},
pages = {18--27},
abstract={Several peer consistency mechanisms have been proposed to incentivize agents for honestly solving crowdsourcing tasks. These game-theoretic mechanisms evaluate the answers provided by an agent based on the correlation with answers provided by other agents ("peers") who solve the same tasks. In this paper, we consider the problem of eliciting personal attributes (for e.g. body measurements) of the agents. Since attributes are personal in nature, the tasks can not be shared between two agents. We show for the first time how to extend a peer consistency incentive mechanism, the Logarithmic Peer Truth Serum, to this setting for collecting personal attributes. When individuals report combinations of multiple personal data attributes, the correlation between them can be exploited to find peers. This new mechanism applies, for example, to collecting personal health records and other multi-attribute measurements at private properties such as smart homes. We provide a theoretical analysis of the incentive properties of the new mechanism and show the performance of the mechanism on several public datasets, which confirm the theoretical analysis.}

title = {Conditional Expectation Propagation},
author= {Wang, Zheng and Zhe, Shandian},
pages = {28--37},
abstract={Expectation propagation (EP) is a powerful approximate inference algorithm. However, a critical barrier in applying EP is that the moment matching in message updates can be intractable. Handcrafting approximations is usually tricky, and lacks generalizability. Importance sampling is very expensive. While Laplace propagation offers an excellent solution, it has to run numerical optimizations to find Laplace approximations in every update, which is still quite inefficient. To overcome these practical barriers, we propose conditional expectation propagation (CEP) that performs conditional moment matching given the variables outside each message fixed, and then takes expectation w.r.t their approximate posterior. The conditional moments are often analytical and much easier to derive. In the most general case, we can use (fully) factorized messages so that the conditional moments can be represented by quadrature formulas. We then compute the expectation of the conditional moments via Taylor approximations when necessary. In this way, our algorithm can always conduct efficient, analytical fixed point iterations. Experiments on several popular models for which standard EP is available or unavailable demonstrate the advantages of CEP in both inference quality and computational efficiency.}

title = {A Sparse Representation-Based Approach to Linear Regression with Partially Shuffled Labels},
author= { Slawski, Martin and Rahmani, Mostafa and Li, Ping},
pages = {38--48},
abstract={Several recent papers have discussed a modification of linear regression in which the correspondence between input variables and labels is missing or erroneous, referred to as "Linear Regression with Unknown Permutation",  or "Linear Regression with Shuffled Data". Prior studies of this setup have shed light on the associated statistical limits. However, practical and well-founded approaches that overcome the computational challenges of the setup are still scarce. In this paper, we translate the problem of linear regression with unknown permutation to a robust subspace recovery problem, or alternatively, outlier recovery problem. Outliers correspond to mismatched data, and a specific sparse representation of the data is used to detect the outliers. The proposed approach requires at least a reasonably large fraction (but potentially significantly less than 50\%) of the response-predictor pairs to be in correct correspondence. This assumption is often justified, e.g., if record linkage based on additional contextual information is sufficiently accurate to enable correct matching of such fraction of the data. It turns out that in this situation, estimation of the regression parameter on the one hand and recovery of the underlying permutation on the other hand can be decoupled so that the computational hardness associated with the latter can be sidestepped. }

pages = {49--59},
abstract={Many machine learning techniques sacrifice convenient computational structures to gain estimation robustness and modeling flexibility. However, by exploring the modeling structures, we find these ``sacrifices'' do not always require more computational efforts. To shed light on such a ``free-lunch'' phenomenon, we study the square-root-Lasso (SQRT-Lasso) type regression problem. Specifically, we show that the nonsmooth loss functions of SQRT-Lasso type regression ease tuning effort and gain adaptivity to inhomogeneous noise, but is not necessarily more challenging than Lasso in computation. We can directly apply proximal algorithms (e.g. proximal gradient descent, proximal Newton, and proximal quasi-Newton algorithms) without worrying about the nonsmoothness of the loss function. Theoretically, we prove that the proximal algorithms combined with the pathwise optimization scheme enjoy fast convergence guarantees with high probability. Numerical results are provided to support our theory.}

author= { Verma, Tanvi and Varakantham, Pradeep},
pages = {60--70},
abstract={Aggregation systems (e.g., Uber, Lyft, Food- Panda, Deliveroo) have been increasingly used to improve efficiency in numerous environments, including in transportation, logistics, food and grocery delivery. In these systems, a centralized entity (e.g., Uber) aggregates sup- ply and assigns them to demand so as to optimize a central metric such as profit, number of requests, delay etc. Due to optimizing a metric of importance to the centralized entity, the interests of individuals (e.g., drivers, de- livery boys) can be sacrificed. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the problem of serving individual interests, i.e., learning revenue maximizing policies for individuals in the presence of a self interested central entity. Since there are large number of learning agents that are homogenous, we represent the problem as an Anonymous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learn- ing (AyMARL) problem. By using the self interested centralized entity as a correlation entity, we provide a novel learning mechanism that helps individual agents to maximize their individual revenue. Our Correlated Learning (CL) algorithm is able to outperform existing mechanisms on a generic simulator for aggregation systems and multiple other benchmark Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems.}

abstract={We prove the main rules of causal calculus (also called do-calculus) for i/o structural causal models (ioSCMs), a generalization of a recently proposed general class of non-linear structural causal models that allow for cycles, latent confounders and arbitrary probability distributions. We also generalize adjustment criteria and formulas from the acyclic setting to the general one (i.e. ioSCMs). Such criteria then allow to estimate (conditional) causal effects from observational data that was (partially) gathered under selection bias and cycles. This generalizes the backdoor criterion, the selection-backdoor criterion and extensions of these to arbitrary ioSCMs. Together, our results thus enable causal reasoning in the presence of cycles, latent confounders and selection bias. Finally, we extend the ID algorithm for the identification of causal effects to ioSCMs.}

author= { Gouvert, Olivier and Oberlin, Thomas and F{\'{e}}votte, C{\'{e}}dric},
pages = {91--101},
abstract={Count data are often used in recommender systems: they are widespread (song play counts, product purchases, clicks on web pages) and can reveal user preference without any explicit rating from the user. Such data are known to be sparse, over-dispersed and bursty, which makes their direct use in recommender systems challenging, often leading to pre-processing steps such as binarization. The aim of this paper is to build recommender systems from these raw data, by means of the recently proposed compound Poisson Factorization (cPF). The paper contributions are three-fold: we present a unified framework for discrete data (dcPF), leading to an adaptive and scalable algorithm; we show that our framework achieves a trade-off between Poisson Factorization (PF) applied to raw and binarized data; we study four specific instances that are relevant to recommendation and exhibit new links with combinatorics. Experiments with three different datasets show that dcPF is able to effectively adjust to over-dispersion, leading to better recommendation scores when compared with PF on either raw or binarized data.}

author= { Xiong, Hao and Guo, Yuanzhen and Yang, Yibo and Ruozzi, Nicholas},
pages = {102--112},
abstract={Statistical inference in Markov random fields (MRFs) is NP-hard in all but the simplest of cases.  As a result, many algorithms, particularly in the case of discrete random variables, have been developed to perform approximate inference in practice.  However, most of these methods scale poorly, cannot be applied to continuous random variables, or are too slow to be used in situations that call for repeated statistical inference on the same model.  In this work, we propose a novel variational inference strategy that is flexible enough to handle both continuous and discrete random variables, efficient enough to be able to handle repeated statistical inferences, and scalable enough, via modern GPUs, to be practical on MRFs with hundreds of thousands of random variables.  We prove that our approach overcomes weaknesses of the current approaches and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both synthetic models and real-world applications.}

title = {Truly Proximal Policy Optimization},
author= { Wang, Yuhui and He, Hao and Tan, Xiaoyang},
pages = {113--122},
abstract={Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most successful deep reinforcement learning methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of challenging tasks. However, its optimization behavior is still far from being fully understood. In this paper, we show that PPO could neither strictly restrict the probability ratio as it attempts to do nor enforce a well-defined trust region constraint, which means that it may still suffer from the risk of performance instability. To address this issue, we present an enhanced PPO method, named Trust Region-based PPO with Rollback (TR-PPO-RB). Two critical improvements are made in our method: 1) it adopts a new clipping function to support a rollback behavior to restrict the ratio between the new policy and the old one; 2) the triggering condition for clipping is replaced with a trust region-based one, which is theoretically justified according to the trust region theorem. It seems, by adhering more truly to the “proximal” property − restricting the policy within the trust region, the new algorithm improves the original PPO on both stability and sample efficiency.}

abstract={Methods for learning and planning in sequential decision problems often assume the learner is aware of all possible states and actions in advance. This assumption is sometimes untenable. In this paper, we give a method to learn factored markov decision problems from both domain exploration and expert assistance, which guarantees convergence to near-optimal behaviour, even when the agent begins unaware of factors critical to success. Our experiments show our agent learns optimal behaviour on both small and large problems, and that conserving information on discovering new possibilities results in faster convergence.}

pages = {134--144},
abstract={A simple, flexible approach to creating expressive priors in Gaussian process (GP) models makes new kernels from a combination of basic kernels, e.g. summing a periodic and linear kernel can capture seasonal variation with a long term trend. Despite a well-studied link between GPs and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), the BNN analogue of this has not yet been explored. This paper derives BNN architectures mirroring such kernel combinations. Furthermore, it shows how BNNs can produce periodic kernels, which are often useful in this context. These ideas provide a principled approach to designing BNNs that incorporate prior knowledge about a function. We showcase the practical value of these ideas with illustrative experiments in supervised and reinforcement learning settings.}

abstract={Probabilistic survival predictions (i.e. personalized survival curves) from models trained with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) can have high, and sometimes unacceptably high variance.  The field of meteorology, where the paradigm of maximizing sharpness subject to calibration is popular, has addressed this problem  by using scoring rules beyond MLE, such as the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). In this paper we present the \emph{Survival-CRPS}, a generalization of the CRPS to the survival prediction setting, with right-censored and interval-censored variants. We evaluate our ideas on the mortality prediction task using two different Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sets (STARR and MIMIC-III) covering millions of patients, with suitable deep neural network architectures: a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for STARR and a Fully Connected Network (FCN) for MIMIC-III. We compare results between the two different scoring rules while keeping the network architecture and data fixed, and show that models trained with Survival-CRPS result in sharper predictive distributions compared to those trained by MLE, while still maintaining calibration.}

abstract={Mortal bandits have proven to be extremely useful for providing news article recommendations, running automated online advertising campaigns, and for other applications where the set of available options changes over time. Previous work on this problem showed how to regulate exploration of new arms when they have recently appeared, but they do not adapt when the arms are about to disappear. Since in most applications we can determine either exactly or approximately when arms will disappear, we can leverage this information to improve performance: we should not be exploring arms that are about to disappear. We provide adaptations of algorithms, regret bounds, and experiments for this study, showing a clear benefit from regulating greed (exploration/exploitation) for arms that will soon disappear. We illustrate numerical performance on the Yahoo! Front Page Today Module User Click Log Dataset.}

pages = {164--174},
abstract={The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm has been widely used in minimizing the negative log likelihood (also known as cross entropy) of mixture models. However, little is understood about the goodness of the fixed points it converges to. In this paper, we study the regions where one component is missing in two-component mixture models, which we call one-cluster regions. We analyze the propensity of such regions to trap EM and gradient descent (GD) for mixtures of two Gaussians and mixtures of two Bernoullis. In the case of Gaussian mixtures, EM escapes one-cluster regions exponentially fast, while GD escapes them linearly fast. In the case of mixtures of Bernoullis, we find that there exist one-cluster regions that are stable for GD and therefore trap GD, but those regions are unstable for EM, allowing {EM}  to escape. Those regions are local minima that appear universally in experiments and can be arbitrarily bad. This work implies that EM is less likely than GD to converge to certain bad local optima in mixture models. }

abstract={Weighted model integration (WMI) extends Weighted model counting (WMC) to the integration of functions over mixed discrete-continuous domains. It has shown tremendous promise for solving inference problems in graphical models and probabilistic programming. Yet, state-of-the-art tools for WMI are limited in terms of performance and ignore the independence structure that is crucial to improving efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose an efficient model integration algorithm for theories with tree primal graphs. We exploit the sparse graph structure by using search to performing integration. Our algorithm greatly improves the computational efficiency on such problems and exploits context-specific independence between variables. Experimental results show dramatic speedups compared to existing WMI solvers on problems with tree-shaped dependencies.}

abstract={We consider the problem of inferring causal relationships between two or more passively observed variables. While the problem of such causal discovery has been extensively studied especially in the bivariate setting, the majority of current methods assume a linear causal relationship, and the few methods which consider non-linear dependencies usually make the assumption of additive noise. Here, we propose a framework through which we can perform causal discovery in the presence of general non-linear relationships. The proposed method is based on recent progress in non-linear independent component analysis and exploits the non-stationarity of observations in order to recover the underlying sources or latent disturbances. We show rigorously that in the case of bivariate causal discovery, such non-linear ICA can be used to infer the causal direction via a series of independence tests. We further propose an alternative measure of causal direction based on asymptotic approximations to the likelihood ratio, as well as an extension to multivariate causal discovery. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method via a series of simulation studies and conclude with an application to neuroimaging data. }

pages = {196--206},
abstract={In this paper, we study the problem of safe online learning to re-rank, where user feedback is used to improve the quality of displayed lists. Learning to rank has traditionally been studied in two settings. In the offline setting, rankers are typically learned from relevance labels created by judges. This approach has generally become standard in industrial applications of ranking, such as search. However, this approach lacks exploration and thus is limited by the information content of the offline training data. In the online setting, an algorithm can experiment with lists and learn from feedback on them in a sequential fashion. Bandit algorithms are well-suited for this setting but they tend to learn user preferences from scratch, which results in a high initial cost of exploration. This poses an additional challenge of safe exploration in ranked lists. We propose BubbleRank, a bandit algorithm for safe re-ranking that combines the strengths of both the offline and online settings. The algorithm starts with an initial base list and improves it online by gradually exchanging higher-ranked less attractive items for lower-ranked more attractive items. We prove an upper bound on the n-step regret of BubbleRank that degrades gracefully with the quality of the initial base list. Our theoretical findings are supported by extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world click dataset.}

abstract={We study data-driven assistants that provide congestion forecasts to users of shared facilities (roads, cafeterias, etc.), to support coordination between them, and increase efficiency of such collective systems. Key questions are: (1) when and how much can (accurate) predictions help for coordination, and (2) which assistant algorithms reach optimal predictions? First we lay conceptual ground for this setting where user preferences are a priori unknown and predictions influence outcomes. Addressing (1), we establish conditions under which self-fulfilling prophecies, i.e., “perfect” (probabilistic) predictions of what will happen, solve the coordination problem in the gametheoretic sense of selecting a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE). Next we prove that such prophecies exist even in large-scale settings where only aggregated statistics about users are available. This entails a new (nonatomic) BNE existence result. Addressing (2), we propose two assistant algorithms that sequentially learn from users’ reactions, together with optimality/ convergence guarantees. We validate one of them in a large real-world experiment.}

This applies to settings in which a variable is measured with multiple experimental modalities, and where the goal is to synthesize the disparate measurements into a single unified representation.

When the views are considered separately, this reduces to nonlinear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for which it is provably impossible to undo the mixing. We present novel identifiability proofs that this is possible when the multiple views are considered jointly, showing that the mixing can theoretically be undone using function approximators such as deep neural networks. In contrast to known identifiability results for nonlinear ICA, we prove that independent latent sources with arbitrary mixing can be recovered as long as multiple, sufficiently different noisy views are available. }

Our analysis builds upon two simple structural results that boil down to randomized matrix multiplication, a fundamental and well-understood primitive of randomized linear algebra. We analyze the behavior of RFDA when leverage scores and ridge leverage scores are used to select predictor variables, and prove that accurate approximations can be achieved by a sample whose size depends on the effective degrees of freedom of the RFDA problem.

abstract={Randomized hashing algorithms have seen recent success in providing bounds on the model count of a propositional formula.  These methods repeatedly check the satisfiability of a formula subject to increasingly stringent random constraints.  Key to these approaches is the choice of a fixed family of hash functions that strikes a good balance between computational efficiency and statistical guarantees for a hypothetical worst case formula.  In this paper we propose a scheme where the family of hash functions is chosen adaptively, based on properties of the specific input formula.  Akin to adaptive importance sampling, we use solutions to the formula (found during the bounding procedure of current methods) to estimate properties of the solution set, which guides the construction of random constraints. Additionally, we introduce an orthogonal variance reduction technique that is broadly applicable to hashing based methods.  We empirically show that, when combined, these approaches lead to better lower bounds on existing benchmarks, with a median improvement factor of 2^13 over 1,198 propositional formulas.}

pages = {281--291},
abstract={Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are notoriously difficult to train and the reasons underlying their (non-)convergence behaviors are still not completely understood. By first considering a simple yet representative GAN example, we mathematically analyze its local convergence behavior in a non-asymptotic way. Furthermore, the analysis is extended to general GANs under certain assumptions. We find that in order to ensure a good convergence rate, two factors of the Jacobian in the GAN training dynamics should be simultaneously avoided, which are (i) the Phase Factor, i.e., the Jacobian has complex eigenvalues with a large imaginary-to-real ratio, and (ii) the Conditioning Factor, i.e., the Jacobian is ill-conditioned. Previous methods of regularizing the Jacobian can only alleviate one of these two factors, while making the other more severe. Thus we propose a new JAcobian REgularization (JARE) for GANs, which simultaneously addresses both factors by construction. Finally, we conduct experiments that confirm our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the advantages of JARE over previous methods in stabilizing GANs.}

In this paper, we apply the momentum scheme to cubic regularized (CR) Newton's method and explore the potential for acceleration. Our numerical experiments on various nonconvex optimization problems demonstrate that the momentum scheme can substantially facilitate the convergence of cubic regularization, and perform even better than the Nesterov's acceleration scheme for CR. Theoretically, we prove that CR under momentum achieves the best possible convergence rate to a second-order stationary point for nonconvex optimization. Moreover, we study the proposed algorithm for solving problems satisfying an error bound condition and establish a local quadratic convergence rate. Then, particularly for finite-sum problems, we show that the proposed algorithm can allow computational inexactness that reduces the overall sample complexity without degrading the convergence rate.}

A long line of work starting from Wright (1920) has focused on understanding which sub-classes of LSEM allow for efficient parameter recovery. Despite decades of study, this question is not yet fully resolved. The goal of the present paper is complementary to this line of work: we want to understand the stability of the recovery problem in the cases when efficient recovery is possible. Numerical stability of Pearl's notion of causality was first studied in Schulman and Srivastava (2016) using the concept of condition number where they provide ill-conditioned examples. In this work, we provide a condition number analysis for the LSEM. First we prove that under a sufficient condition, for a certain sub-class of LSEM that are bow-free (Brito and Pearl (2002)), parameter recovery is numerically stable. We further prove that randomly chosen input parameters for this family satisfy the condition with a substantial probability. Hence for this family, on a large subset of parameter space, recovery is stable. Next we construct an example of LSEM on four vertices with unbounded condition number. We then corroborate our theoretical findings via simulations as well as real-world experiments for a sociology application. Finally, we provide a general heuristic for estimating the condition number of any LSEM instance. }

abstract={Sum-product networks (SPNs) are expressive probabilistic models with a rich set of exact and efficient inference routines. However, in order to guarantee exact inference, they require specific structural constraints, which complicate learning SPNs from data. Thereby, most SPN structure learners proposed so far are tedious to tune, do not scale easily, and are not easily integrated with deep learning frameworks. In this paper, we follow a simple ``deep learning'' approach, by generating unspecialized random structures, scalable to millions of parameters, and subsequently applying GPU-based optimization. Somewhat surprisingly, our models often perform on par with state-of-the-art SPN structure learners and deep neural networks on a diverse range of generative and discriminative scenarios. At the same time, our models yield well-calibrated uncertainties, and stand out among most deep generative and discriminative models in being robust to missing features and being able to detect anomalies.}

Existing approaches rely on queries to a relational conditional independence (RCI) oracle to establish and orient causal relations in such a setting. In practice, queries to a RCI oracle have to be replaced by reliable tests for RCI against available data. Relational data present several unique challenges in testing for RCI. We study the conditions under which traditional iid-based CI tests yield reliable answers to RCI queries against relational data. We show how to conduct CI tests against relational data to robustly recover the underlying relational causal structure. Results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.}

abstract={The choice of how to retain information about past gradients dramatically affects the convergence properties of state-of-the-art stochastic optimization methods, such as Heavy-ball, Nesterov's momentum, RMSprop and Adam. Building on this observation, we use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to explicitly study the role of memory in gradient-based algorithms. We first derive a general continuous-time model that can incorporate arbitrary types of memory, for both deterministic and stochastic settings. We provide convergence guarantees for this SDE for weakly-quasi-convex and quadratically growing functions. We then demonstrate how to discretize this SDE to get a flexible discrete-time algorithm that can implement a board spectrum of memories ranging from short- to long-term. Not only does this algorithm increase the degrees of freedom in algorithmic choice for practitioners but it also comes with better stability properties than classical momentum in the convex stochastic setting. In particular, no iterate averaging is needed for convergence. Interestingly, our analysis also provides a novel interpretation of Nesterov's momentum as stable gradient amplification and highlights a possible reason for its unstable behavior in the (convex) stochastic setting. Furthermore, we discuss the use of long term memory for second-moment estimation in adaptive methods, such as Adam and RMSprop. Finally, we provide an extensive experimental study of the effect of different types of memory in both convex and nonconvex settings.}

Leveraging these observations, we evaluate both random search with early-stopping and a novel random search with weight-sharing algorithm on two standard NAS benchmarks—PTB and CIFAR-10. Our results show that random search with early-stopping is a competitive NAS baseline, e.g., it performs at least as well as ENAS, a leading NAS method, on both benchmarks. Additionally, random search with weight-sharing outperforms random search with early-stopping, achieving a state-of-the-art NAS result on PTB and a highly competitive result on CIFAR-10.

abstract={We consider the problem of precision matrix estimation where, due to extraneous confounding of the underlying precision matrix, the data are independent but not identically distributed. While such confounding occurs in many scientific problems, our approach is inspired by recent neuroscientific research suggesting that brain function, as measured using functional magnetic resonance imagine (fMRI), is susceptible to confounding by physiological noise such as breathing and subject motion. Following the scientific motivation, we propose a graphical model, which in turn motivates a joint nonparametric estimator.  We provide theoretical guarantees for the consistency and the convergence rate of the proposed estimator. In addition, we demonstrate that the optimization of the proposed estimator can be transformed into a series of linear programming problems, and thus be efficiently solved in parallel. Empirical results are presented using simulated and real brain imaging data, which suggest that our approach improves precision matrix estimation, as compared to baselines, when confounding is present.}

abstract={We study the problem of causal identification from an arbitrary collection of observational and experimental distributions, and substantive knowledge about the phenomenon under investigation, which usually comes in the form of a causal graph. We call this problem  \textit{g-identifiability}, or gID for short. The gID setting encompasses two  well-known problems in causal inference, namely, identifiability [Pearl, 1995] and z-identifiability [Bareinboim and Pearl, 2012] -- the former assumes that an observational distribution is necessarily available, and no experiments can be performed, conditions that are both relaxed in the gID setting; the latter assumes that \textit{all} combinations of experiments are available, i.e., the power set of the experimental set $\mathbf{Z}$, which gID does not require a priori. In this paper, we introduce a general strategy to prove non-gID based on \textit{hedgelets} and \textit{thickets}, which leads to a necessary and sufficient graphical condition for the corresponding decision problem. We further develop a procedure for systematically computing the target effect, and prove that it is sound and complete for gID instances. In other words, failure of the algorithm in returning an expression implies that the target effect is not computable from the available distributions. Finally, as a corollary of these results, we show that do-calculus is complete for the task of g-identifiability.}

abstract={Scientific imaging techniques such as optical and electron microscopy and computed tomography (CT) scanning are used to study the 3D structure of an object through 2D observations.  These observations are related to the original 3D object through orthogonal integral projections. For common 3D reconstruction algorithms, computational efficiency requires the modeling of the 3D structures to take place in Fourier space by applying the Fourier slice theorem. At present, it is unclear how to differentiate through the projection operator, and hence current learning algorithms can not rely on gradient based methods to optimize 3D structure models.  In this paper we show how back-propagation through the projection operator in Fourier space can be achieved. We demonstrate the validity of the approach with experiments on 3D reconstruction of proteins. We further extend our approach to learning probabilistic models of 3D objects. This allows us to predict regions of low sampling rates or estimate noise. A higher sample efficiency can be reached by utilizing the learned uncertainties of the 3D structure as an unsupervised estimate of the model fit. Finally, we demonstrate how the reconstruction algorithm can be extended with an amortized inference scheme on unknown attributes such as object pose. Through empirical studies we show that joint inference of the 3D structure and the object pose becomes more difficult when the ground truth object contains more symmetries. Due to the presence of for instance (approximate) rotational symmetries, the pose estimation can easily get stuck in local optima, inhibiting a fine-grained high-quality estimate of the 3D structure.  }

abstract={Randomized value functions offer a promising approach towards the challenge of efficient exploration in complex environments with high dimensional state and action spaces. Unlike traditional point estimate methods, randomized value functions maintain a posterior distribution over action-space values. This prevents the agent’s behavior policy from prematurely exploiting early estimates and falling into local optima. In this work, we leverage recent advances in variational Bayesian neural networks and combine these with traditional Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to achieve randomized value functions for high-dimensional domains. In particular, we augment DQN and DDPG with multiplicative normalizing flows in order to track a rich approximate posterior distribution over the parameters of the value function. This allows the agent to perform approximate Thompson sampling in a computationally efficient manner via stochastic gradient methods. We demonstrate the benefits  of our approach through an empirical comparison in high dimensional environments. }

We address this challenge by developing an Inexact Proximal point method for exact Optimal Transport problem (IPOT) with the proximal operator approximately evaluated at each iteration using projections to the probability simplex. The algorithm (a) converges to exact Wasserstein distance with theoretical guarantee and robust regularization parameter selection, (b) alleviates numerical stability issue, (c) has similar computational complexity to Sinkhorn, and (d) avoids the shrinking problem when applies to generative models. Furthermore, a new algorithm is proposed based on IPOT to obtain sharper Wasserstein barycenter.}

abstract={Latent dynamics discovery is challenging in extracting complex dynamics from highdimensional noisy neural data. Many dimensionality reduction methods have been widely adopted to extract low-dimensional, smooth and time-evolving latent trajectories. However, simple state transition structures, linear embedding assumptions, or inflexible inference networks impede the accurate recovery of dynamic portraits. In this paper, we propose a novel latent dynamic model that is capable of capturing nonlinear, non- Markovian, long short-term time-dependent dynamics via recurrent neural networks and tackling complex nonlinear embedding via non-parametric Gaussian process. Due to the complexity and intractability of the model and its inference, we also provide a powerful inference network with bi-directional long short-term memory networks that encode both past and future information into posterior distributions. In the experiment, we show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing insightful latent dynamics from both simulated and experimental neural datasets with either Gaussian or Poisson observations, especially in the  low-sample scenario.

However, a key limitation of this policy is the specification of epsilon. In this paper, we provide a novel Bayesian perspective of epsilon as a measure of the uncertainty (and hence convergence) in the Q-value function. We introduce a closed-form Bayesian model update based on Bayesian model combination (BMC), based on this new perspective, which allows us to adapt epsilon using experiences from the environment in constant time with monotone convergence guarantees. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm, epsilon-BMC, efficiently balances exploration and exploitation on different problems, performing comparably or outperforming the best tuned fixed annealing schedules and an alternative data-dependent epsilon adaptation scheme proposed in the literature.}

Recent methods developed for scalable neural network verification are based on computing an upper bound on the worst-case violation of the specification. Semidefinite programming (SDP) has been proposed as a means to obtain tight upper bounds. However, SDP solvers do not scale to large neural networks. We introduce a Lagrangian relaxation based on the SDP formulation and a novel algorithm to solve the relaxation that scales to networks that are two orders of magnitude larger than the off-the-shelf SDP solvers. Although verification of neural networks is known to be NP-hard in general, we develop the first known sufficient conditions under which a polynomial time verification algorithm (based on the above relaxation) is guaranteed to perform exact verification (i.e., either verify a property or establish it is untrue). The algorithm can be implemented using primitives available readily in common deep learning frameworks. Experiments show that the algorithm is fast, and is able to compute tight upper bounds on the error rates under adversarial attacks of convolutional networks trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10.}

abstract={Policy Iteration (PI) is a popular family of algorithms to compute an optimal policy for a givenMarkov Decision Problem (MDP). Starting from an arbitrary initial policy, PI repeatedly performs locally-improving switches until an optimal policy is found. The exact form of the switching rule gives rise to different variants of PI. Two decades ago, Mansour and Singh [1999] provided the first non-trivial “strong” upper bound on the number of iterations taken by “Howard’s PI” (HPI), a widelyused variant of PI (strong bounds depend only on the number of states and actions in the MDP). They also proposed a randomised variant (RPI) and showed an even tighter strong upper bound. Their bounds for HPI and RPI have not been improved subsequently.\\ We revisit the algorithms and analysis of Mansour and Singh [1999]. We prove a novel result on the structure of the policy space for k-action MDPs, $k\geq 2$, which generalises a result known for k = 2. Also proposing a new counting argument, we obtain a strong bound of (O$(\sqrt{k \log k}))^n$ iterations for an algorithm akin to RPI, improving significantly upon Mansour and Singh’s original bound of roughly O($(k/2)^n$). Similar analysis of a randomised variant of HPI also yields a strong upper bound of (O($\sqrt{k \log k}))^n$ iterations, registering the first exponential improvement for HPI over the trivial bound of $k^n$. Our other contributions include a lower bound of  $\Omega(n)$ iterations for RPI and an upper bound of $1.6001^n$ iterations for a randomised variant of “Batch-Switching PI” [Kalyanakrishnan et al., 2016a] on 2-action MDPs—the tightest strong upper bound shown yet for the PI family.}

We show this difficulty can be mitigated by projecting the scores onto random vectors before comparing them. This objective, called sliced score matching, only involves Hessian-vector products, which can be easily implemented using reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Therefore, sliced score matching is amenable to more complex models and higher dimensional data compared to score matching. Theoretically, we prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of sliced score matching estimators. Moreover, we demonstrate that sliced score matching can be used to learn deep score estimators for implicit distributions. In our experiments, we show sliced score matching can learn deep energy-based models effectively, and can produce accurate score estimates for applications such as variational inference with implicit distributions and training Wasserstein Auto-Encoders.}

abstract={We study the classical linear bandit problem on \emph{graphs} modelling arm rewards through an underlying graph structure $G$($N$,$E$) such that rewards of neighboring nodes are similar. Previous attempts along this line have primarily considered the arm rewards to be a smooth function over graph Laplacian, which however failed to characterize the inherent problem complexity in terms of the graph structure. We bridge this gap by showing a regret guarantee of $\tO(\chi(\overline{G})\sqrt{T})$ ($\tO(\cdot)$ notation hides dependencies on $\log T$), that scales only with the chromatic number of the complement graph $\chi(\overline{G})$, assuming the rewards to be a smooth function over a general class of graph embeddings---\emph{Orthonormal Representations}. Our proposed algorithms yield a regret guarantee of $\tilde O(r\sqrt T)$ for any general embedding of rank $r$. Furthermore, if the rewards correspond to a minimum rank embedding, the regret boils down to $O(\chi(\overline{G})\sqrt{T})$---none of the existing works were able to bring out such influences of graph structures over arm rewards. Finally noting that computing the above minimum rank embedding is NP-Hard, we also propose an alternative $O(N + |E|)$ time computable embedding scheme---{\it Greedy Embeddings}---based on greedy graph coloring, on which our algorithms perform optimally on a large family of graphs, e.g. union of cliques, complement of $k$-colorable graphs, regular graphs etc, and are also shown to  outperform the state-of-the-art methods on real datasets.

We show how the resulting account handles the discrepancy that can arise between low- and high-level causal models of the same system, and in the process provide an account of how one causal model approximates another, a topic of independent interest.

abstract={Causal approaches to fairness have seen substantial recent interest, both from the machine learning community and from wider parties interested in ethical prediction algorithms. In no small part, this has been due to the fact that causal models allow one to simultaneously leverage data and expert knowledge to remove discriminatory effects from predictions. However, one of the primary assumptions in causal modeling is that you know the causal graph. This introduces a new opportunity for bias, caused by misspecifying the causal model. One common way for misspecification to occur is via unmeasured confounding: the true causal effect between variables is partially described by unobserved quantities. In this work we design tools to assess the sensitivity of fairness measures to this confounding for the popular class of non-linear additive noise models (ANMs). Specifically, we give a procedure for computing the maximum difference between two counterfactually fair predictors, where one has become biased due to confounding. For the case of bivariate confounding our technique can be swiftly computed via a sequence of closed-form updates. For multivariate confounding we give an algorithm that can be efficiently solved via automatic differentiation. We demonstrate our new sensitivity analysis tools in real-world fairness scenarios to assess the bias arising from confounding.}

We demonstrate the inexistence of a principle relationship between both quantities and provide sufficient conditions for a fixed point to be optimal with respect to approximating both the marginals and the partition function.}

abstract={The study of graphical causal models is fundamentally the study of separations and conditional independences. We provide linear time algorithms for two graphical primitives: to test, if a given set is a minimal d-separator, and to find a minimal d-separator in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), completed partially directed acyclic graphs (CPDAGs) and restricted chain graphs (RCGs) as well as minimal m-separators in ancestral graphs (AGs). These algorithms improve the runtime of the best previously known algorithms for minimal separators  that are based on moralization and thus require quadratic time to construct and handle the moral graph. (Minimal) separating sets have important applications like finding (minimal) covariate adjustment sets or conditional instrumental variables.}

abstract={Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) intend to ensure robustness with respect to changing or adversarial system behavior. In this framework, transitions are modeled as arbitrary elements of a known and properly structured uncertainty set and a robust optimal policy can be derived under the worst-case scenario. In this study, we address the issue of learning in RMDPs using a Bayesian approach. We introduce the Uncertainty Robust Bellman Equation (URBE) which encourages safe exploration for adapting the uncertainty set to new observations while preserving robustness. We propose a URBE-based algorithm, DQN-URBE, that scales this method to higher dimensional domains. Our experiments show that the derived URBE-based strategy leads to a better trade-off between less conservative solutions and robustness in the presence of model misspecification. In addition, we show that the DQN-URBE algorithm can adapt significantly faster to changing dynamics online compared to existing robust techniques with fixed uncertainty sets.}

pages = {679--689},
abstract={We consider probabilistic programming for birth-death models of evolution and introduce a new widely-applicable inference method that combines an extension of the alive particle filter (APF) with automatic Rao-Blackwellization via delayed sampling. Birth-death models of evolution are an important family of phylogenetic models of the diversification processes that lead to evolutionary trees. Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) give phylogeneticists a new and exciting tool: their models can be implemented as probabilistic programs with just a basic knowledge of programming. The general inference methods in PPLs reduce the need for external experts, allow quick prototyping and testing, and accelerate the development and deployment of new models. We show how these birth-death models can be implemented as simple programs in existing PPLs, and demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed inference method for such models. For the popular BiSSE model the method yields an increase of the effective sample size and the conditional acceptance rate by a factor of 30 in comparison with a standard bootstrap particle filter. Although concentrating on phylogenetics, the extended APF is a general inference method that shows its strength in situations where particles are often assigned zero weight. In the case when the weights are always positive, the extra cost of using the APF rather than the bootstrap particle filter is negligible, making our method a suitable drop-in replacement for the bootstrap particle filter in probabilistic programming inference.}

We derive an evidence lower bound for this model and propose a specific training method for recovering disentangled features as sparse elements in latent vectors. In our experiments, we demonstrate superior disentanglement performance to standard VAE approaches when an estimate of the number of true sources of variation is not available and objects display different combinations of attributes. Furthermore, the new model provides unique capabilities, such as recovering feature exploitation, synthesising samples that share attributes with a given input object and controlling both discrete and continuous features upon generation.}

abstract={Learning with a convex loss function has been a dominating paradigm for many years. It remains an interesting question how non-convex loss functions help improve the generalization of learning with broad applicability. In this paper, we study a family of objective functions  formed by truncating traditional loss functions, which  is applicable to both shallow learning and deep learning. Truncating loss functions has  potential to be less vulnerable and more robust to large noise in observations that could be adversarial. More importantly, it is a generic technique without assuming the knowledge of  noise distribution. To justify non-convex learning with truncated losses, we establish excess risk bounds of empirical risk minimization based on truncated losses for heavy-tailed output, and statistical error of an approximate stationary point found by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. Our experiments for shallow and deep learning for regression with outliers, corrupted data and heavy-tailed noise further justify the proposed method.}

Here, we set the scene for active learning in BQ when multiple related information sources of variable cost (in input and source) are accessible. This setting arises for example when evaluating the integrand requires a complex simulation to be run that can be approximated by simulating at lower levels of sophistication and at lesser expense. We construct meaningful cost-sensitive multi-source acquisition-rates as an extension to common utility functions from vanilla BQ (VBQ), and discuss pitfalls that arise from blindly generalizing. In proof-of-concept experiments we scrutinize the behavior of our generalized acquisition functions. On an epidemiological model, we demonstrate that active multi-source BQ (AMS-BQ) is more cost-efficient than VBQ in learning the integral to a good accuracy.}

abstract={Online learning, position bias, and diversified retrieval are three crucial aspects in designing ranking systems based on user clicks. One simple click model which explains the position bias is the cascade model. Many online learning variants of the cascade model have been proposed, but none so far captures diversity. Similarly, online learning to rank methods which capture diversity do not handle position bias. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel click model, and the associated online learning variant to address both position bias and diversified retrieval in a unified framework. Despite the objective function not being a standard submodular set function, we prove that a greedy-approach is a reasonable approximation. We then propose, CascadeLSB, an algorithm whose goal is to recommend K most attractive items from a large set of L items with the attractiveness of items being modeled as a submodular utility function. We analyze the algorithm and prove a gap-free upper bound on its n-step regret. We comprehensively evaluate CascadeLSB on synthetic and real datasets, where it  outperforms all the baselines.}

We also identify the role of its trade-off hyperparameter as the capacity of the generator: its Lipschitz constant. Moreover, we prove that optimizing the encoder over any class of universal approximators, such as deterministic neural networks, is enough to come arbitrarily close to the optimum. We therefore advertise this framework, which holds for any metric space and prior, as a sweet-spot of current generative autoencoding objectives.We then introduce the Sinkhorn autoencoder (SAE), which approximates and minimizes the $p$-Wasserstein distance in latent space via backprogation through the Sinkhorn algorithm. SAE directly works on samples, i.e. it models the aggregated posterior as an implicit distribution, with no need for a reparameterization trick for gradients estimations. SAE is thus able to work with different metric spaces and priors with minimal adaptations. We demonstrate the flexibility of SAE on latent spaces with different geometries and priors and compare with other methods on benchmark data sets.}

abstract={Weighted model counting (WMC) is a state-of-the-art technique for probabilistic inference in discrete domains. WMC has recently been extended towards weighted model integration (WMI) in order to handle discrete and continuous distributions alike. While a number of WMI solvers have been introduced, their relationships, strengths and weaknesses are not yet well understood. WMI solving consists of two sub-problems: 1) finding convex polytopes; and 2) integrating over them efficiently. We formalize the first step as $\lambda$-SMT and discuss what strategies solvers apply to solve both the $\lambda$-SMT and the integration problem. This formalization allows us to compare state-of-the-art solvers and their behaviour across different types of WMI problems. Moreover, we identify factorizability of WMI problems as a key property that emerges in the context of probabilistic programming. Problems that can be factorized can be solved more efficiently. However, current solvers exploiting this property restrict themselves to WMI problems with univariate conditions and fully factorizable weight functions. We introduce a new algorithm, F-XSDD, that lifts these restrictions and can exploit factorizability in WMI problems with multivariate conditions and partially factorizable weight functions. Through an empirical evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our approach.}

abstract={Many real world applications can be framed as multi-objective optimization problems, where we wish to simultaneously optimize for multiple criteria. Bayesian optimization techniques for the multi-objective setting are pertinent when the evaluation of the functions in question are expensive. Traditional methods for multi-objective optimization, both Bayesian and otherwise, are aimed at recovering the Pareto front of these objectives. However, in certain cases a practitioner might desire to identify Pareto optimal points only in a subset of the Pareto front due to external considerations. In this work, we propose a strategy based on random scalarizations of the objectives that addresses this problem. Our approach is able to flexibly sample from desired regions of the Pareto front and, computationally, is considerably cheaper than most approaches for MOO. We also study a notion of regret in the multi-objective setting and show that our strategy achieves sublinear regret. We experiment with both synthetic and real-life problems, and demonstrate superior performance of our proposed algorithm in terms of the flexibility and regret.}

First, we demonstrate that existing methods proposed for this problem present an issue that may lead to ill-posed optimization. We then propose an alternative formulation, as well as an efficient algorithm to optimize it. Using ideas from optimization and graph theory, we propose an efficient coordinate-wise minimization algorithm that has a closed form solution for each block subproblem.

We propose a highly flexible and practical approach to multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, focused on efficiently optimizing hyperparameters for iteratively trained supervised learning models.  We introduce a new acquisition function, the trace-aware knowledge-gradient, which efficiently leverages both multiple continuous fidelity controls and trace observations --- values of the objective at a sequence of fidelities, available when varying fidelity using training iterations.

abstract={Truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) is a popular method for learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that saves computation and memory at the cost of bias by truncating backpropagation after a fixed number of lags. In practice, choosing the optimal truncation length is difficult: TBPTT will not converge if the truncation length is too small, or will converge slowly if it is too large. We propose an adaptive TBPTT scheme that converts the problem from choosing a temporal lag to one of choosing a tolerable amount of gradient bias. For many realistic RNNs, the TBPTT gradients decay geometrically in expectation for large lags; under this condition, we can control the bias by varying the truncation length adaptively.  For RNNs with smooth activation functions, we prove that this bias controls the convergence rate of SGD with biased gradients for our non-convex loss. Using this theory, we develop a practical method for adaptively estimating the truncation length during training. We evaluate our adaptive TBPTT method on synthetic data and language modeling tasks and find that our adaptive TBPTT ameliorates the computational pitfalls of fixed TBPTT.}

We show how classical ideas in the literature on exponential families on probabilistic networks provide an excellent starting point to derive uncertainty estimates in Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Our proposal directly quantifies uncertainty deterministically, without the need for costly sampling-based estimation. We show that while uncertainty is quite useful by itself in computer vision and machine learning, we also demonstrate that it can play a key role in enabling statistical analysis with deep networks in neuroimaging studies with normative modeling methods.

abstract={Finding the reduced-dimensional structure is critical to understanding complex networks. Existing approaches such as spectral clustering are applicable only when the full network is explicitly observed. In this paper, we focus on the online factorization and partition of implicit large lumpable networks based on observations from an associated random walk. We formulate this into a nonconvex stochastic factorization problem and propose an efficient and scalable stochastic generalized Hebbian algorithm (GHA). The algorithm is able to process random walk data in a streaming fashion and learn a low-dimensional representation for each vertex. By applying a diffusion approximation analysis, we show that the continuous-time limiting process of the stochastic algorithm converges globally to the “principal components” of the Markov chain. We also establish a finite-sample error bound that matches the nonimprovable state-of-art result for online factorization. Once learned the low-dimensional state representations, we further apply clustering techniques to recover the network partition. We show that when the associated Markov process is lumpable, one can recover the partition exactly with high probability given sufficient data. We apply the proposed approach to model the traffic flow of Manhattan as city-wide random walks. By using our algorithm to analyze the taxi trip data, we discover a latent partition of the Manhattan city that closely matches the traffic dynamics.}

abstract={Obtaining reliable uncertainty estimates of neural network predictions is a long standing challenge. Bayesian neural networks have been proposed as a solution, but it remains open how to specify their prior. In particular, the common practice of an independent normal prior in weight space imposes relatively weak constraints on the function posterior, allowing it to generalize in unforeseen ways on inputs outside of the training distribution. We propose noise contrastive priors (NCPs) to obtain reliable uncertainty estimates. The key idea is to train the model to output high uncertainty for data points outside of the training distribution. NCPs do so using an input prior, which adds noise to the inputs of the current mini batch, and an output prior, which is a wide distribution given these inputs. NCPs are compatible with any model that can output uncertainty estimates, are easy to scale, and yield reliable uncertainty estimates throughout training. Empirically, we show that NCPs prevent overfitting outside of the training distribution and result in uncertainty estimates that are useful for active learning. We demonstrate the scalability of our method on the flight delays data set, where we significantly improve upon previously published results.}

Recent work has suggested that people have an interest in the robot performing well, and will thus behave pedagogically, choosing actions that are informative to the robot. In turn, robots benefit from interpreting the behavior by accounting for this pedagogy. In this work, we focus on misspecification: we argue that robots might not know whether people are being pedagogic or literal and that it is important to ask which assumption is safer to make. We cast objective learning into the more general form of a common-payoff game between the robot and human, and prove that in any such game literal interpretation is more robust to misspecification. Experiments with human data support our theoretical results and point to the sensitivity of the pedagogic assumption.}

To understand this relationship, we develop a multimodal modeling and inference framework that estimates shared latent structure of joint gene expression levels and medical image features. Our method is built around probabilistic canonical correlation analysis (PCCA), which is fit to image embeddings that are learned using convolutional neural networks and linear embeddings of paired gene expression data. Using a differentiable take on the EM algorithm, we train the model end-to-end so that the PCCA and neural network parameters are estimated simultaneously. We demonstrate the utility of this method in constructing image features that are predictive of gene expression levels on simulated data and the Genotype-Tissue Expression data. We demonstrate that the latent variables are interpretable by disentangling the latent subspace through shared and modality-specific views.}

abstract={In this paper, we propose an approximate relative value learning (ARVL) algorithm for non- parametric MDPs with continuous state space and finite actions and average reward criterion. It is a sampling based algorithm combined with kernel density estimation and function approximation via nearest neighbors. The theoretical analysis is done via a random contraction operator framework and stochastic dominance argument. This is the first such algorithm for continuous state space MDPs with average re- ward criteria with these provable properties which does not require any discretization of state space as far as we know. We then evaluate the proposed algorithm on a benchmark problem numerically.}

abstract={We consider the problem of sampling directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from a given distribution. We assume the sampling distribution is modular, i.e., the probability of a DAG is a product of local factors, each of which only depends on a node and its parents in the DAG. Using inclusion–exclusion recurrence relations, we give an exact sampler that requires Õ(3^n) time for preprocessing and Õ(2^n) per sample, where n is the number of nodes and Õ suppresses polylogarithmic factors. We also consider the symmetric special case where the factors only depend on the size of the parent set—this covers uniform sampling under indegree constraints. In this case, our exact sampler requires O(n^3) time for preprocessing and O(n^2) per sample; this outperforms the previous best bound even for the uniform distribution. We demonstrate the performance of both samplers also empirically.}

abstract={A foundational tool for making causal inferences is the emulation of randomized control trials via variable interventions. This approach has been applied to a wide variety of contexts, from health to economics [3, 6]. Variable interventions have long been studied in independent and identically distributed (iid) data contexts, but recently non-iid settings, such as networks with interacting agents [8, 17, 28] have attracted interest. In this paper, we propose a type of structural intervention [12] relevant in network contexts: the network intervention. Rather than estimating the effect of changing variables, we consider changes to social network structure resulting from creation or severance of ties between agents. We define the individual participant and average bystander effects for these interventions and describe identification criteria. We then prove a series of theoretical results that show existing identification theory obtains minimally KL-divergent distributions corresponding to network interventions. Finally, we demonstrate estimation of effects of network interventions via a simulation study.}

Traditional approaches typically search an area exhaustively, thereby ignoring that the density of victims varies based on predictable factors, such as the terrain, population density and the type of disaster. We present a probabilistic model to automate SAR planning, with explicit minimization of the expected time to discovery. The proposed model is a spatial point process with three interacting spatial fields for i) the point patterns of persons in the area, ii) the probability of detecting persons and iii) the probability of injury. This structure allows inclusion of informative priors from e.g. geographic or cell phone traffic data, while falling back to latent Gaussian processes when priors are missing or inaccurate. To solve this problem in real-time, we propose a combination of fast approximate inference using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), and a novel Monte Carlo tree search tailored to the problem. Experiments using data simulated from real world Geographic Information System (GIS) maps show that the framework outperforms competing approaches, finding many more injured in the crucial first hours.}

Specifically, we aim to learn an intervention model to promote the spread of true news in a social network—in order to mitigate the impact of fake news. We model news diffusion as a Multivariate Hawkes Process (MHP) and make interventions that are learnt via policy optimization. The key insight is to estimate the response a user will get from the social network upon sharing a post, as it indicates her impact on diffusion, and will  thus help in efficient allocation of incentive. User responses also depend on political bias and peer influence, which we model as a second MHP, interleaving it with the news diffusion process. We evaluate our model on semi-synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms other alternatives that do not consider estimates of user responses and political bias when learning how to allocate incentives.}

abstract={On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have high sample complexity while off-policy algorithms are difficult to tune. Merging the two holds the promise to develop efficient algorithms that generalize across diverse environments. It is however challenging in practice to find suitable hyper-parameters that govern this trade off. This paper develops a simple algorithm named P3O that interleaves off-policy updates with on-policy updates. P3O uses the effective sample size between the behavior policy and the target policy to control how far they can be from each other and does not introduce any additional hyper-parameters. Extensive experiments on the Atari-2600 and MuJoCo benchmark suites show that this simple technique is effective in reducing the sample complexity of state-of-the-art algorithms.

abstract={Classical causal and statistical inference methods typically assume the observed data consists of independent realizations. However, in many applications this assumption is inappropriate due to a network of dependences between units in the data. Methods for estimating causal effects have been developed in the setting where the structure of dependence between units is known exactly, but in practice there is often substantial uncertainty about the precise network structure. This is true, for example, in trial data drawn from vulnerable communities where social ties are difficult to query directly. In this paper we combine techniques from the structure learning and interference literatures in causal inference, proposing a general method for estimating causal effects under data dependence when the structure of this dependence is not known a priori. We demonstrate the utility of our method on synthetic datasets which exhibit network dependence.}

abstract={Stochastic control-flow models (SCFMs) are a class of generative models that involve branching on choices from discrete random variables. Amortized gradient-based learning of SCFMs is challenging as most approaches targeting discrete variables rely on their continuous relaxations—which can be intractable in SCFMs, as branching on relaxations requires evaluating all (exponentially many) branching paths. Tractable alternatives mainly combine REINFORCE with complex control-variate schemes to improve the variance of naive estimators. Here, we revisit the reweighted wake-sleep (RWS) [5] algorithm, and through extensive evaluations, show that it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in learning SCFMs. Further, in contrast to the importance weighted autoencoder, we observe that RWS learns better models and inference networks with increasing numbers of particles. Our results suggest that RWS is a competitive, often preferable, alternative for learning SCFMs.}

abstract={The Information Bottleneck (IB) method (Tishby et al. (2000)) provides an insightful and principled approach for balancing compression and prediction for representation learning. The IB objective I (X ; Z ) − βI(Y ; Z) employs a Lagrange multiplier β to tune this trade-off. However, in practice, not only is β chosen empirically without theoretical guidance, there is also a lack of theoretical understanding between β, learnability, the intrinsic nature of the dataset and model capacity. In this paper, we show that if β is improperly chosen, learning cannot happen – the trivial representation P(Z|X) = P(Z) becomes the global minimum of the IB objective. We show how this can be avoided, by identifying a sharp phase transition between the unlearnable and the learnable which arises as β is varied. This phase transition defines the concept of IB-Learnability. We prove several sufficient conditions for IB-Learnability, which provides theoretical guidance for choosing a good β. We further show that IB-learnability is determined by the largest confident, typical, and imbalanced subset of the examples (the conspicuous subset), and discuss its relation with model capacity. We give practical algorithms to estimate the minimum β for a given dataset. We also empirically demonstrate our theoretical conditions with analyses of synthetic datasets, MNIST, and CIFAR10.}

Belief representations, which characterize the distribution over the latent states in a POMDP, have been modeled using recurrent neural networks and probabilistic latent variable models, and shown to be effective for reinforcement learning in POMDPs. In this work, we investigate the belief representation learning problem for generative adversarial imitation learning in POMDPs. Instead of training the belief module and the policy separately as suggested in prior work, we learn the belief module jointly with the policy, using a task-aware imitation loss to ensure that the representation is more aligned with the policy’s objective. To improve robustness of representation, we introduce several informative belief regularization techniques, including multi-step prediction of dynamics and action-sequences. Evaluated on various partially observable continuous-control locomotion tasks, our belief-module imitation learning approach (BMIL) substantially outperforms several baselines, including the original GAIL algorithm and the task-agnostic belief learning algorithm.

abstract={Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is a measure of conditional dependence between random variables X and Y, given another random variable Z. It can be used to quantify conditional dependence among variables in many data-driven inference problems such as graphical models, causal learning, feature selection and time-series analysis. While k-nearest neighbor (kNN) based estimators as well as kernel-based methods have been widely used for CMI estimation, they suffer severely from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we leverage advances in classifiers and generative models to design methods for CMI estimation. Specifically, we introduce an estimator for KL-Divergence based on the likelihood ratio by training a classifier to distinguish the observed joint distribution from the product distribution. We then show how to construct several CMI estimators using this basic divergence estimator by drawing ideas from conditional generative models. We demonstrate that the estimates from our proposed approaches do not degrade in performance with increasing dimension and obtain significant improvement over the widely used KSG estimator. Finally, as an application of accurate CMI estimation, we use our best estimator for conditional independence testing and achieve superior performance than the state-of-the-art tester on both simulated and real data-sets.}

We propose a matching framework for IV in the presence of observed categorical confounders that addresses these weaknesses. Our method first matches units exactly, and then consecutively drops variables to approximately match the remaining units on as many variables as possible. We show that our algorithm constructs better matches than other existing methods on simulated datasets, and we produce interesting results in an application to political canvassing.}

To achieve this, we first propose a mixed-type multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) to jointly model the continuous target function and binary auxiliary functions. Then, we propose information-based acquisition functions such as mixed-type entropy search (MT-ES) and mixed-type predictive ES (MT-PES) for mixed-type BO based on the MOGP predictive belief of the target and auxiliary functions. The exact acquisition functions of MT-ES and MT-PES cannot be computed in closed form and need to be approximated. We derive an efficient approximation of MT-PES via a novel mixed-type random features approximation of the MOGP model whose cross-correlation structure between the target and auxiliary functions can be exploited for improving the belief of the global target maximizer using the observations from evaluating these functions. We also propose new practical constraints to relate the global target maximizer to the binary auxiliary functions.

abstract={While MCMC methods have become a main work-horse for Bayesian inference, scaling them to large distributed datasets is still a challenge. Embarrassingly parallel MCMC strategies take a divide-and-conquer stance to achieve this by writing the target posterior as a product of subposteriors, running MCMC for each of them in parallel and subsequently combining the results. The challenge then lies in devising efficient aggregation strategies. Current strategies  trade-off between approximation quality, and costs of communication and computation. In this work, we introduce a novel method that addresses these issues simultaneously. Our key insight is to introduce a deep invertible transformation to approximate each of the subposteriors. These approximations can be made accurate even for complex distributions and serve as intermediate representations, keeping the total communication cost limited. Moreover, they enable us to sample from the product of the subposteriors using an efficient and stable importance sampling scheme. We demonstrate that the approach outperforms available state-of-the-art methods in a range of challenging scenarios, including high-dimensional and heterogeneous subposteriors.}
